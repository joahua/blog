You&#8217;ll note, if you happen to be unfortunate enough to be trying to view this webpage in any web browser other than something based on the [Mozilla][1] rendering engine, that the menubar accross the top sucks.

I just thought I&#8217;d point this out, and laugh at you. ;)

The joys of running a personal website, not subject to review&#8230; I&#8217;m fairly sure it&#8217;s still standards compliant, though &#8211; the CMS I&#8217;ve developed will basically *make* me comply with standards&#8230; I have no real choice in that matter. Of course, having said that, I haven&#8217;t actually \*tested\* this for compliance yet, so I&#8217;m liable to being ripped up and reduced to a quivering heap when I actually \*do\* try to validate it sometime. We shall see.

Oh, and I will fix it sometime. I just can&#8217;t be bothered right now, considering it looks so nice from where I&#8217;m sitting ;)
