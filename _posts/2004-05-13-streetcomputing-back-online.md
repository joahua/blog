Well, I just finished up the latest batch of assessment tasks, and amid my procrastination last night (against a maths assessment today, which went suprisingly well, I think &#8211; of course, thinking that BEFORE getting marks back is suicide, but hey) came a compulsive desire to design a website.

And here it is.

For more on exactly how, why, and how long, take a look at the about page.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s just say that my coding self-esteem is pretty good at the minute.&nbsp; Heh&#8230; until, of course, the bugs reports start rolling in;)&nbsp; No, that won&#8217;t happen as much, I don&#8217;t think&#8230; this particular CMS has been in use in miscellaneous other places in various forms for several months now, and more recently, in a more complete, polished form, on the [Platform Seven][1] website.

We shall see exactly what happens with this in the next few days&#8230; I have a weekend without any assessments!!! This is incredible!!!&nbsp; I have a life again&#8230; well, I have free time again&#8230; the life is somewhat more optional.
