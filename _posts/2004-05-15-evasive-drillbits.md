So all week I had today in my diary as the day I&#8217;d finally get rid of that bloody cable I keep tripping on, which travels out the door of the Place I Sleep (that is, "bed"room) to the Place I Live (that is, computer desk) providing access to a Place I Go Often (that is, the Internet).&nbsp; Earlier this week (Tuesday, from memory), I&#8217;d dutifully visited a Place That Sells Stuff (that is, Jaycar) and purchased some things that attach to walls and have sockets in them.

The intent, of course, was to move the cable out from my room to somewhere more directly adjacent to the &#8216;phone and data services in this strange place.&nbsp; Which was fine.&nbsp; And good.&nbsp; And comparably well planned, as far as my doing of these things goes.

My (fathers) drillbits, however, seem to have become something of a scarce commodity around here.&nbsp; As have various holesaw attachments, which complicates the whole affair somewhat &#8211; trying to get cables to go through holes into/out of the floor into wall cavities and then out of/into another hole in aforementioned wall is fun at the best of times, but when you&#8217;re drilling in a floorspace with a 1/5" bit and trying to fit some Cat5 through that, and magically align with another hole made with a bit the same size in the wall above you, things get&#8230; interesting.

Insert expletives here&#8230; the cable nightmare continues, at least for another few weeks until either  
a) the drillbits are found, or  
b) I do something completely irrational, and go out and buy some more out of impatience &#8211; of course, the missing bits (hehe&#8230; there was about thirty of them in various sets, plus a holesaw attachment) will instantaneously show up the moment I buy the drillbits, but hey &#8211; then there&#8217;d be forty.&nbsp; I&#8217;m unsure whether or not that would be a good thing&#8230;
