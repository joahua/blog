If you&#8217;ve used any non-Mozilla/Linux webbrowsers to access this site over the past few days, then you&#8217;d have realised things weren&#8217;t [quite as they should be][1].

If you&#8217;re viewing it now in any browser, the link bar should display acceptably, although I preferred the old look as displayed in Mozilla&#8230; such is the price of progress, I suppose ;)

At any rate, it would have annoyed me to no end when I accessed it from anywhere else (i.e. studyhall or another place which I find similarly boring), so its fixed now.

Enjoy, all people with BrowsersThatSuck&trade; ;)
