Don&#8217;t worry, those three aren&#8217;t significantly connected.&nbsp; I mean, the former two are slowly ruining my life, although they are yet to conspire together to form some monstrous plot&#8230;&nbsp; the latter of those two continues to frustrate in the same way as I&#8217;ve previously whinged about, whilst the first is completely separate and a new issue altogether (and the third, well, it&#8217;s been around for a few days, but I haven&#8217;t had a chance to compain about it yet).

See, unlike certain people (no offense to anyone ;), I only keep \*one\* diary and calendar (admittedly, they are separate physical objects, but I make a habit of checking BOTH before scheduling anything), with the theoretical goal of not having to be in two places at once too often.&nbsp; And then there were parents.&nbsp; Well, specifically, a mother, with her OWN calendar, and her OWN agenda when it came to scheduling meetings with certain dental workers.&nbsp; Insert a pun about going "mental" here&#8230; haha.&nbsp; Or not.

My mobile is another source of angst.&nbsp; Apologies to everyone who&#8217;s sent me an SMS recently and hasn&#8217;t got a reply &#8211; this is a case of PEBPAWIBM (Problem Exists Between Phone And Whatever Is Behind Me) in conjunction with an ingenious feature that will cancel any message left too long half-written.&nbsp; No, really, thanks Samsung.&nbsp; Geez, it&#8217;s so useful returning me to the main menu of the phone &#8211; if I were to leave a phone in my pocket with a message half typed, that is far more dangerous than an unlocked phone at a dial screen, of course.&nbsp; And it would be, of course, completely irrational to dump me from my message, forget it, and then \*actually lock the phone so something doesn&#8217;t happen by accident\* &#8211; no, I was using the phone, you couldn&#8217;t possibly lock it.&nbsp; Dumping me to a menu is greatly appreciated, though.

Samsung deserve an award for usability.&nbsp; I propose the award be supplied in an un-openable box, as an example of how accessible products should be in recognition of their most excellent achievements in this field.

On a completely unrelated note to any of the above, thanks Ben for lending me your 40GB harddrive&#8230; I now have room to breathe in my home directory again (although I have somehow managed to ALREADY fill 20GB of that 40&#8230; go figure), at least for the next few months.

It&#8217;s kind of funny, that.&nbsp; Six months ago, I would have said that at my current rate of consumption, it&#8217;d probably take me about three years to fill 40GB.&nbsp; Nowdays, I go through about 1GB a week (much of which is simply deleted or burnt to CD, but still) of storage space on various mediums&#8230; admittedly, this is largely due to my storage of the raw audio captures from [Platform Seven][1] for streaming and archival purposes, but a lot of it is from other stuff as well&#8230; Platform Seven accounts for less than half of that 1GB/week usage.

So yes, I now have my music back!!&nbsp; Yep, I had it before, but my CD&#8217;s are in the next room &#8211; technically, we&#8217;re not allowed to convert copyrighted material between mediums here in Australia, but MP3&#8242;s (and, in the near future, OGG files) are just so much more convenient for me that I am past caring.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never heard a complaint from anyone about this usage, anyway, even from various [record][2] [associations][3] &#8211; of course, the issue of "fair use" has never been a prominent one, since everyone ASSUMES that Australia has identical copyright laws to the US.&nbsp; Just for the record (haha, get it?), this is not so, and if you&#8217;re in a position to do something about getting our laws changed, or know what to do about it, let me know/do something.
