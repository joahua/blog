No, OGG audio files aren&#8217;t the same, for two reasons.&nbsp; One, eggs are pretty far from my favorite foodstuff (ranking slightly better than seafood), and, whilst I wouldn&#8217;t attempt to eat an audio file, I&#8217;m sure that if it *was* edible, I would enjoy it far more, and secondly, eggs don&#8217;t have per-track and album custom gain and peak settings.

Neither do MP3 files, for that matter.&nbsp; There you have it.&nbsp; Conclusive proof that there \*is\* a difference between eggs and oggs&#8230; and a possible connection between MP3s and eggs.

I don&#8217;t like MP3s.&nbsp; Although they&#8217;re not as bad as fish&#8230;
