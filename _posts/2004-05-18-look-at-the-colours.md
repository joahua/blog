I read an interesting blog entry [here][1] today, on the various methods of selecting colour schemes for a website.

Whilst I&#8217;ve heard of the first two methodologies being used, I don&#8217;t think I ever really took it seriously&#8230; the "colours from nature" thing is something that I&#8217;d only heard spoken of briefly, and never really followed up.

Shows how great nature is, I guess, if we can even make great looking websites out of it!! ;)&nbsp; Thanks God for colour schemes!
