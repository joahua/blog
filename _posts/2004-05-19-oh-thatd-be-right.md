The first post I make after accessing it with uberly expensive WAP&nbsp; just *happens* to be the 11th, pushing the filesize of the front page down to slightly above 4KB, or 15c.

As mentioned [previously][1], dentists are the cause of all sorts of angst when it comes to double bookings by certain people&#8230; now exorbitant mobile costs can be added to that list ;)

Got to love dentists.&nbsp; I&#8217;m meant to be going back in a few weeks&#8230; an opportunity for "most expensive post"?
