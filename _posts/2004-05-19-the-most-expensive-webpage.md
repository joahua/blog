&#8230;that I&#8217;ve ever accessed is this one.&nbsp; At the dentist (or, nuisu, as I imaginatively managed to spell it in an SMS to someone), this afternoon.&nbsp; I&#8217;m pleased to note that this page displays pretty nicely on a WAP browser, although the 3c/KB cost is somewhat prohibitive.

I checked the size of the front page when I got home, and I&#8217;m thinking the most it could have cost me is 51c, which I can deal with, I guess&#8230;&nbsp; I was thinking about making my "most expensive post ever" FROM my phone&#8230; now THAT would have been cool&#8230; but then I realised that would be two webpages away, and I could see this getting ridiculous &#8211; especially seeing that (of course), I would have to check the front page again (another 51c + the amount of data in the message posted x 3c) just to make sure that it worked&#8230; putting an entry up via WAP could easily come to $2 without blinking.

Which is kind of scary, seeing the most I&#8217;d ever paid for internet before then was $2.50/five minutes for 33.6k dialup in a dodgy Western Australia hotel.&nbsp; But anyway.&nbsp; That is an experience I&#8217;d rather not reflect on, thankyou.

This experience, however, rates as downright cool&#8230; I *so* better not make this a habit, or my mobile bill will be&#8230; lets just say several kilobytes in length.
