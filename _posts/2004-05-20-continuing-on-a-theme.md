I&#8217;ve discovered that the browser client software on my phone is known as "UP.browser", developed by a company called [Openwave][1].&nbsp; My phone wasn&#8217;t listed, of course, but unless there was another person trying to access this website using a mobile device, or my phone is lying about its identity, I&#8217;m running that&#8230; which is kind of cool, seeing that they allegedly have 51% mobile-data market penetration, and have a downloadable [phone-simulator][2], meaning, of course, that I can waste even more time testing on platforms that no-one will use!!!

Hey, at least it&#8217;ll be cheaper to play with than 3c/KB mobile rates ;).&nbsp; I can see the time vanishing before my eyes already.&nbsp; Bring on the [coffee][3]!!
