At least, that is what the St. Andrews History department would have us believe.&nbsp; Try as I might, I can&#8217;t for the life of me remember/find where Assessment 2 got to, and yet I have in my hand a paper entitled:  

Modern History  
Preliminary Course
Task Three: Research

Are you confused?&nbsp; I&#8217;m confused.&nbsp; About this, I mean&#8230; other things aside, for once.&nbsp; So, since we have received Task 1, and these things are normally distributed chronologically, one would assume that the NEXT task received (i.e. Task 3) is less than two (provided, of course, we are permitted to accept 2 as a positive integer) &#8211; there you have it, proof that two is greater than three.

And if there is anything wrong with my maths, I don&#8217;t want to know about it, okay?&nbsp; There is a reason that I haven&#8217;t implemented a comment system here&#8230;

&#8230;I can&#8217;t be bothered.
