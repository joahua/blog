I&#8217;m off to a place called "Vision Valley" for the next two days, which I am told is not a drug rehabilitation center.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t believe them, but hey, we shall see.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t really got any major drug dependencies anyway, so they can&#8217;t work on those addictions, at least.

Anyway.&nbsp; Back on Tuesday evening.
