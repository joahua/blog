Yay, it&#8217;s that time of year (I&#8217;ve never quite figured out how often it is) again, and it&#8217;s been raining for several days on and off, which is generally acknowledged to be a complete kill of any geek hopes of salvaging weird and wonderful posessions from the various piles in front of peoples houses.

Not THIS geek!!!

This morning I discovered something of a hidden treasure on my way to school &#8211; enclosed in a box which had previously housed one of those "entertainment system" mini-ish PC&#8217;s (this box was soggy, and people wouldn&#8217;t throw out a working system, which are the only two reasons I think it hadn&#8217;t already been nabbed by someone else) was a lovely Super Power case, complete with 350W power supply!!! Wooo!!!

Now, who had a power supply die on them a few months ago?&nbsp; And who had been putting off purchasing a new one for no real reason?&nbsp; YEAH!!!! MEEEE!!!!

Of course, because of the rain and all that, I&#8217;m unsure whether it actually works yet (I&#8217;ve got "attack PSU w/ hair dryer" written in my diary &#8211; no, seriously&#8230; if you don&#8217;t believe me, nab me sometime and I&#8217;ll show you!) &#8211; but its cool that someone just threw it out!!!&nbsp; Well&#8230; cool where cool equals extremely wasteful and uncaring about the financial or environmental cost of IT goods&#8230; but still!

I&#8217;m planning on going for a bit of a jog sometime later tonight to better scout my suburb for miscellaneous goodies that no-one else has found yet (seeing cleanup is technically Monday, I&#8217;m not too hopeful &#8211; generally, you&#8217;ve got about 10 hours after stuff is thrown out to find it.&nbsp; Walks late on Sunday night are good, but I forgot to, and on Monday I was at the Retreat :( ).

Should this thing work, I shall once again have a working P3, without any cost incurred to me!&nbsp; Woooo!

Yeah, the excitement shall wear off shortly &#8211; until then, I&#8217;ll not be able to concentrate on things that I really should&#8230; mmm&#8230; assessments.&nbsp; I found out today that apparently I have an ITF task due Monday.&nbsp; Not a big thing in itself, but I&#8217;m sure that I was never told about it&#8230; I&#8217;m kind of tempted to just not hand it in and say I wasn&#8217;t notified of it &#8211; sure, I&#8217;d fail it, but its almost worth it just to make a point.&nbsp; ARGH that subject sucks&#8230; its so tedious and unstructured &#8211; not to mention generally disorganised &#8211; we still haven&#8217;t got the LAST assessment back yet, and that was several months ago now.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t drop it, though &#8211; it counts for four units (inc. Cisco random stuff), and that&#8217;d take me below the required minimum of 12.&nbsp; Bleh!

Mmm capacitor discharge from wet powersupplies&#8230;
