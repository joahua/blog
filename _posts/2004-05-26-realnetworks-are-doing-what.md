Apparently, they&#8217;re releasing the source code for RealPlayer (Linux version) sometime in the near future.&nbsp; Whilst binaries of this have been available for some time (Real has been one of few major software vendors to commit to long term support of such a platform, which has been excellent &#8211; I won&#8217;t comment on the OTHER issues surrounding their software, but their cross-platform thing has been good).

Their Helix Community (Helix Player) project has been around and opensourced for some time (under the terms of their own license, the [RPSL][1]), but there is now talk and a suggestive line on the website which would imply that Real are likely to release the source to their flagship product, RealPlayer.&nbsp; "Coming soon." is the official line next to the RealPlayer download link on <http://player.helixcommunity.org> &#8211; not that it matters much, because [apparently][2] the Helix Player now supports OGG, a handful of Real&#8217;s formats (that being the thing which they had previously held as proprietry and hadn&#8217;t been supported by the Helix product tree), as well as MPEGs plus a few million other weird and wonderful media formats.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t seen anything indicating with any great certainty whether the RealAudio/Video and streaming formats are covered by this license, however [this][2] page would suggest that perhaps they have been&#8230;&nbsp; it seems like a completely unviable business direction to take, especially coming from a firm with something of a history of not so consumer-focused products (read: spyware).

Their encoding products have always been really easy to use, and just generally rocked, and I&#8217;m hoping that this move doesn&#8217;t affect that.
