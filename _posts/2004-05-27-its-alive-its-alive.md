Woooo!!! I&#8217;ve got myself a freebie PSU!&nbsp; Go council cleanups!

Hehehe&#8230; my parents started giving me looks telling me to get off the computer last night &#8211; so, I got off the computer, went into my room, pulled out the power supply, build a Pentium 2 box, and (somewhat nervously) plugged in the ATX power supply which I had just screwed back together, having been over it with a tissue soaking up any excess moisture left over.

Ahhh, the blissful sound of fans spinning up, and computers beeping because there is no monitor plugged in!!&nbsp; Actually, that&#8217;s not quite accurate.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t make that much sound at all &#8211; it&#8217;s a really quiet PSU!&nbsp; Which is cool.&nbsp; Very cool.

350W of goodness, council cleanups rock :)
