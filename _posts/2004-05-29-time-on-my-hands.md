For once.&nbsp; This is cool&#8230; I&#8217;ve got two pages of "To-do&#8217;s", but at least I&#8217;m not weighed down by school work instead of being able to get stuck into the list.

Hehe&#8230; well, rather, I \*should\* probably be doing school work, but am not, as computer stuff is far more fun/profitable/both than school work ever was.&nbsp; I mean, seriously &#8211; aside from maths, and other content-driven courses (the only one which I am doing at the minute is Modern History), what exactly are we meant to learn in school?!

Okay, here we go &#8211; listing subjects, and then progressively attacking each and every one of them.&nbsp; Ready?

**Advanced English:** No comment. Insert comments about being assessed on under two sentences here.&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m still not over that bloody assessment.

**Physics:** Apparently it is more comprehension "can-you-read-the-question" now than it used to be &#8211; it&#8217;d help if we had a PHYSICS teacher to teach us, but hey.&nbsp; Until such a time as that situation changes, that is another subject in which nothing is being learnt.&nbsp; Private study aside.

**ITF:** That subject is something of a joke.&nbsp; Competent/Not competent provides amazing scope for doing absolutely nothing and being rewarded for it.&nbsp; I&#8217;d go so far as to call it communism.

**Business:**&nbsp; King-common-sense.&nbsp; Learn a few terms, tick the various boxes, write a report, unit completed.&nbsp; I like it, although it may be dead boring at times.

**Extension English:**&nbsp; Okay, I kind of enjoy this one.&nbsp; I&#8217;d go so far as to say that it&#8217;s right up there with Modern &#8211; that said, the reasons for my liking it are completely different.

As you can probably see, I&#8217;m not thinking too highly of most subjects at the minute.&nbsp; Modern is cool, because, well, the course is nice, and our teacher is great, and maths is&#8230; yeah, maths is, there is little more that is required to be said about it.

To break it down a little further, English sucks because the department is, well, a little bit&#8230; I&#8217;ll say "misguided" &#8211; you can think about who is supposedly guiding the department, and draw your own conclusions there.&nbsp; ITF sucks because the course is a "Framework" &#8211; which SACS apparently hasn&#8217;t really filled in too well (no, using a universities online curriculum to teach a course does NOT qualify as education), and because there are four classes in the one room, which does bend things towards anarchy, just a little.&nbsp; Physics sucks because the teacher isn&#8217;t a physics teacher, and the head of department is obsessed with a vegetable and pointed dots, and, finally, Business sucks because there is no thought required &#8211; that said, it is easy to see why that is a subject I&#8217;m doing fairly well in ;).

So yes.&nbsp; Time on my hands means whinging about departments, and code.&nbsp; Lots of code.

Wink nudge, a new feature possibly on the way.
