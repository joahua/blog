Yay!&nbsp; That evil, bandwidth consuming, link-following, unintelligent POS has finally been banned from this server by a [certain admin][1].

Despite the random meddlings of the evil MSN bot, everything is still running fine (unless, of course, you happen to be trying to access this website from an address in the 65.54.164.x range, in which case, you&#8217;re screwed).&nbsp; So fine, in fact, that another website hosted on this same server, administered by the aforementioned admin, just hit 16,000 posts.&nbsp; Not bad for a community [forum][2] started on a weekend sometime last year (Mar 16, 2003).

Yeah.&nbsp; Cool factor++.&nbsp; And stuff.

*p.s. that feature still in the works &#8211; I have no idea where my weekend went&#8230; was the most inefficient use of time ever, methinks.&nbsp; Personally, I&#8217;m blaming Novell/Ximian for open-sourcing a certain product, but I shall rant on that later, if I remember to&#8230;*
