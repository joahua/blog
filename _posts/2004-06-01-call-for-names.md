Hmm&#8230; I&#8217;ve decided to make use of the commenting system, both because I can, and because it&#8217;s genuinely something useful in this instance. Yep, that&#8217;s right &#8212; &#8220;KLICKING DA BUTTN!&#8221; has useful applications! Just, err, remember to type a message first, okay? Good. If you don&#8217;t, then not much happens&#8230;

So, this &#8220;call for names&#8221; isn&#8217;t about conscription or anything. I don&#8217;t want YOUR names&#8230; well&#8230; I do want your name, if you&#8217;ve got a cool name or something. No, I&#8217;m just hopeless at deciding on names of any kind, and I&#8217;m meant to be writing this short story thingamajig for English. I&#8217;m needing at least two names &#8212; one which sounds &#0252;berly evil, and another which is that of a victim &#8212; who becomes evil by the actions of the &#0252;berly evil one. Get all that?

So, two names &#8212; a really evil one, and a moderately normal (but preferably obscure, because obscure names are cool) name&#8230; yeah. See, I wasn&#8217;t wasting my time developing a commenting system! It has genuine applications in the field of&#8230; err&#8230; name harvesting?

Why do I sound like a spammer&#8230;
