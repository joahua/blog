Just not always on time.&nbsp; But, as vaguely indicated would occur, a new feature has emerged on this website.

It gives me the opportunity to ask stupid questions, and get stupider answers.&nbsp; As opposed to asking stupider questions, and not getting *ANY* answers.

I&#8217;m still wondering which is better, but hey.&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; Cool new feature, and all that.&nbsp; Try it out.&nbsp; I hope it works.&nbsp; Or, at least, pretends to work.&nbsp; That form really just emails your comment to a monkey, who has to manually edit the webpage &#8211; no databases around here, kiddies.

Just for the record, I&#8217;m joking.&nbsp; That&#8217;s MY monkey, animal rights activists!!
