**English Journal Entry #1**  
*Wednesday, June 02, 2004*

Today was the first time all of our group confirmed that, in fact, we WERE a group (I was absent when the assessment was handed out), and we discussed a few things.

Having determined who was in the group, we set out to agree on a plot of sorts.&nbsp; The first suggestion was that we satirise, and generally poke a stick in the direction of, the politics (and associated envy) associated with positions of student leadership at SACS.&nbsp; Upon reflection, this potentially would have been offensive&#8230; and a better idea was reached.&nbsp; The original wasn&#8217;t anywhere near twisted enough for our groups liking, so we embarked on something a little more warped.

Essentially, the plot is three characters in a play are jealous over the parts of each other.&nbsp; The play being our group presentation, the jealousy being related to our parts within the play and the individual marking of these roles.&nbsp; We&#8217;re playing ourselves in a play about ourselves &#8212; recursively, the play is set in the development of the play itself.&nbsp; So, scripting will be based on real dialog occurring in our preparation.

We&#8217;ll be making use of soliloquies, having (forcibly brief, given the four-minute time constraint) moments of reflection in which various characters reveal their thoughts (whilst the other two are &#8220;frozen&#8221; in time).
