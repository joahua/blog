Yeah.&nbsp; They&#8217;re pretty cool.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got myself six meters of seriously fat [Figure 8][1] audio cable for absolutely nothing.&nbsp; That rates as cool in my book.

So, whilst they&#8217;re giving me free stuff, I&#8217;ll give them a little bit of a plug.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve got this new clock released this year, okay?&nbsp; Now, normally I absolutely hate all that gimmicky crap they&#8217;re moving towards, but this is very cool.&nbsp; Product number is XC0170, and it&#8217;s not listed on their website yet (as of this evening at 6:02PM)&#8230; you know how you get those things which have metal rods in them, and you press your hand on one side, and get an imprint on the other?&nbsp; Like a RealWorld&trade; emboss filter?&nbsp; Yeah, that&#8217;s how this clock displays the time!

Very cool.&nbsp; It&#8217;s $99, which is kind of expensive for something that tells the time, but has immense leet factor.

So why were Jaycar giving me free stuff?&nbsp; I mean, I&#8217;m cool and all, but still&#8230;&nbsp; Yeah, okay, I&#8217;m not cool.&nbsp; But I *did* send in my "Send me a free catalog next year" form in LAST years catalog.&nbsp; And apparently, AusPost wanted to charge them $10/copy to mail out (it&#8217;s a kinda chunky catalog &#8211; good thing [Farnell][2] don&#8217;t use AusPost&#8230; actually, I think they&#8217;ve abandoned the free mailout idea.&nbsp; For those who don&#8217;t know, their catalog is literally about the size of a pair of Yellow Pages books, and they used to (possibly still do) mail it out for free.) &#8211; so Jaycar went "well screw them, let&#8217;s milk it for all it&#8217;s worth in terms of customer goodwill!"

Hey, I have no problems with that.&nbsp; I had to choose between getting $10 worth of free stuff and collecting a catalog in person, or BUYING A STAMP, sending a RealMail&trade; (i.e. not email!) to Jaycar, and then having to WAIT for AusPost to get this catalog to me.&nbsp; Mmmm&#8230; hard decision.

So yeah, I randomly wandered down to Jaycar this arvo ([Ben][3] tagged along), picked up a free catalog, and jumped on an offcut of cable (six meters!), because it was so incredibly cheap (list price was six bucks, but zero is better!), and also another blue LED, just to offset the spare change (which they can&#8217;t give &#8211; the LED was $3.95, so I only "lost" 5 cents).

The LED will be going in a CD drive eventually, I think.&nbsp; Yet to decide which one.&nbsp; Whenever it happens, I&#8217;ll post something.

In other LED-related news, Jaycar have [Luxeon Stars][4] in their catalog!!! Woooo!!!&nbsp; Can&#8217;t wait to get some and randomly put them all over the place!&nbsp; Go hugely insane power suckage!!

Ooooh&#8230; and they also have TRI COLOUR LED&#8217;s&#8230; none of this auto-switching crap, these have actually got like four pins on them (or three, or something&#8230; I can&#8217;t remember)!&nbsp; If I had skill, then I&#8217;d start trying to build some [massive LED display device][5]&#8230; but I don&#8217;t, and no-one is paying me to try ;).

So yeah.&nbsp; Excited about lots of geeky stuff.&nbsp; Very cool.&nbsp; Go buy stuff from Jaycar ;)
