No time to post, brief version of the day:

HP printer back today.  
No significant news on the SACS IT satire front.  
The evil hax0rz box has been removed &#8211; I was planning on writing a song about it, maybe later.  
Platform 7 recording (I don&#8217;t think) happened this week, I got their late, and no-one handed me a tape at the end &#8211; at any rate, no recording shall be uploaded this weekend, unless someone else emails me it/about it.  
The streaming server is down and out, anyway &#8211; reasons behind this are still TBC, but I&#8217;m inclined to blame IT.&nbsp; Again.
