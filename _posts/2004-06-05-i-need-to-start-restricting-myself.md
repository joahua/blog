I&#8217;m about to have another dig at SACS IT.&nbsp; Stop reading now if you don&#8217;t want to hear any more.

So, they&#8217;re a school, right?&nbsp; You&#8217;d presume that they, like most other businesses, would experience peak activity sometime during the week.&nbsp; You&#8217;d be wrong.

A few attacks ago, I made reference to the schools&#8217; email system (specifically staffmail &#8211; studentmail reliably delivers all my spam quite nicely.&nbsp; Scary thing is, I haven&#8217;t ever used that address for anything outside school!&nbsp; Since I started checking studentmail from home, I&#8217;ve picked up 263 spam messages &#8211; I think that was about two months ago, now.&nbsp; Sure, it&#8217;s well below my regular account, but then &#8220;jstreet@subdomain.subdomain.statecode.edu.au&#8221; is hardly as predictable as &#8220;josh@majorisp.net&#8221;, you would think.) &#8212; well, that&#8217;s what is currently on the &#8220;this thing sucks&#8221; list.

(n.b. I&#8217;ve decided I want to add some sections to this site for that kind of stuff &#8211; random thoughts of the moment, etc.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll stop interrupting myself, now&#8230;)

So on Friday, a certain ITSS teacher sent out an email to all Cisco academy students (basically to check that it was all workingish), with a request that people replied upon reciept.&nbsp; So, people did.&nbsp; People the proceeded to get messages such as this one, politely sent in reply from the schools&#8217; staff email server:

You really do have to wonder what kind of network congestion an email server at an academic institution can be experiencing at ten o&#8217;clock on a Saturday night&#8230;

<small>Just for the record, I didn&#8217;t get an error when I sent my reply to the email.&nbsp; That one was courtesy of Michael Dale.</small>
