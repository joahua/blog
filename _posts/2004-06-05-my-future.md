I was going through a folder today which contained various stuff, and stumbled accross a piece of paper which had been written on the way to reha&#8230; the place where we had visions.

This has no real relevance to anything, at least, no more than most things posted here do, but I found it, and it&#8217;s kinda cool (I still don&#8217;t get how it works), so I&#8217;m posting it.&nbsp; If you want to know how on earth it is worked out, ask Tori!

I will end up marrying Katy, drive a Tricycle, have -3 (yes, negative three) children, and work in web development.

One out of four?

I think it was something like come up with five names of people from the opposite gender, five modes of transport, five numbers, and five occupations, and then draw some random spiral thingamajig.&nbsp; I was following it okay up until then&#8230; guess I&#8217;ll just have to trust her on the actual results, hey? :p

For those who care enough to want to know what COULD have happened:  
**Names:** Tori, Sam, Katy, Kylie, Kim  
**Transport:** Tricycle, Dump Truck, Unicycle, Limo, Jet ski  
**Numbers:** -3, 9, 28, 3000, 2  
**Occupations:** Custodial engineer, Waiter, Web developer, Sign painter, Butler.

Anyway, if you see me driving a tricycle anytime soon, be afraid. ;)
