Just because Kim wrote the URL in my english folder, and because there are some very cool pictures up in her gallery, a behemoth link to her site: <http://elfwood.lysator.liu.se/loth/l/i/lithanya/>

No progress on the HP front &#8211; I&#8217;m thinking there is something screwy with my parallel port &#8211; perhaps it IS time to bother taking this mobo back&#8230; hmm.&nbsp; Onboard sound frazzled a few months ago, and I&#8217;ve been putting off replacing it &#8211; perhaps parallel got cooked simultaneously?&nbsp; Shrug.&nbsp; It wouldn&#8217;t be a problem, but for the fact that I&#8217;m unable to locate the USB cable for the damn thing.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll have a look around later for that, I guess.

As best I can tell, the Platform Seven streaming media server is still down &#8212; so, even if a recording was made, it couldn&#8217;t be uploaded until Monday at the earliest.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve had enough of a whinge about IT @ SACS in recent days, so I won&#8217;t say any more, other than that I think an outage may be in connection with paranoia over certain other&#8230; system compromises.&nbsp; Pure speculation, so don&#8217;t bother attacking me over that statement.

Even if I don&#8217;t give them abuse about it, another site hosted on the same server probably *will* &#8212; as malicious as this may seem, the longer it is out, the better &#8211; lower QoS means that people are more likely to start jumping up and down, making noise, and generally demanding that certain problems be resolved.&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s the theory, anyway.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve sent emails to staff at SACS before and had them arrive four days late &#8211; whilst iiNet&#8217;s mail servers aren&#8217;t wonderful, if there was that kind of a delay, then they send out NetStatus messages about it, which didn&#8217;t happen, so I&#8217;m assuming it was a SACS problem, and not iiNet&#8217;s.&nbsp; The worst thing is, people haven&#8217;t jumped up and down that much about it.&nbsp; Brewing discontent, perhaps, but we&#8217;re yet to hit a stage of open rebellion.

When THAT happens, it will be most interesting to watch.&nbsp; Call Ticketek on 9266 4800 now.&nbsp; Err&#8230; okay, maybe not.

As alluded to yesterday, I was planning on writing a song about a certain series of events which have been happening over the past week.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t say anything more than what I have already, but some people may find it vaguely amusing, so what the heck.

To the tune of *Pete Murray &#8211; So Beautiful*:

Built this box just the other day  
Installed FC1 booted away,  
Hackin&#8217; about j00,  
Hackin&#8217; the net j00&#8242;re in,  
What you up too where you /bin?  
(Just hackin&#8217;)

And all the packages j00 wear,  
And the users in your /home  
Shouldn&#8217;t chown you  
Now you tell me why it&#8217;s so  
You bigger than mighty Windows,  
(At least you think so)

God my fingers burn,  
Now when I think of hacking your lair  
You have changed so much that I don&#8217;t know,  
If I can login and tell you I care  
And I would love to bring you down,  
Set your uptime back on the ground

Throw my mouse down on the desk,  
Turn my head, start to stress,  
(They&#8217;re coming after me)  
Compromises are so sweet  
Always so much fun, so l33t  
(At least I thought so)

Now you think j00&#8242;re so damn fine  
j00 can&#8217;t rule the &#8216;net no not mine,  
I don&#8217;t think so.

God my fingers burn,  
Now when I think of hacking your lair  
You have changed so much that I don&#8217;t know,  
If I can login and tell you I care

Now the scan that you&#8217;re in,  
And the users that login  
Just get to me,  
But j00 think I&#8217;m not as cool,  
As j00 are so skillful  
Well who j00 fooling

Well I&#8217;m here to tell you babe  
The game j00&#8242;re in is just a game  
So damn pretentious

God my fingers burn,  
Now when I think of hacking your lair  
You have changed so much that I don&#8217;t know,  
If I can login and tell you I care  
And I would love to bring you down,  
Set your uptime back on the ground

You think you&#8217;re so skillful  
(So skillful)
