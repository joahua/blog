Wooooooo!!!!&nbsp; My HP is working again \*grins\* <&#8212; see, I&#8217;m happy.

Albeit only in black and white &#8211; that, however, is no fault of mine, so all is good.&nbsp; Currently looking into exactly what is the cause of that problem (something hardwareish &#8211; heh&#8230; I almost said layer 1&#8230; doh, I&#8217;m a geek.)&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t manage to work miracles with the parallel, though &#8211; ye good ole USB cable was retrieved from the depths of a briefcase, so that&#8217;s (fortunately) what I&#8217;m using.

Scanning is working great, xsane preserving sanity&#8230; I hadn&#8217;t used it before, for a first experience, it was great.&nbsp; Kinda antiquated interface, but still, it was usable, and worked without a glitch to be spoken of.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy.

Back to chopping down trees, I suppose&#8230;
