Following feedback from Dale, the "Full Post | Comments (number of comments here)" thing is now aligned left.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think it makes that much of a difference, and personally, I was used to it being on the right &#8211; I&#8217;m gonna leave it a few days and see if I come to like it, and to see whether or not visitors like it.

Apparently a New Zealand man sent [80,012 text messages][1] in protest against the removal of an unlimited message plan.&nbsp; Really makes you wonder why Telecom got rid of it, hey.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t believe how stupid someone could be.&nbsp; Seriously.

Let&#8217;s assume a moderate charge per message of 20cents &#8211; that, multiplied by 80,012.&nbsp; Divided by 100.&nbsp; Equals sixteen thousand and two dollars, and fourty cents.

What a freakin&#8217; genius.&nbsp; Not only did he manage to prove why his phone provider had to withdraw the plan (i.e. network spamming and abuse), it also cost him $16,000.40!

Perhaps Telecom NZ are evil, but this isn&#8217;t a particularly good reason why &#8211; look at their local-loop regulation or something (heh, and Telstra Australia crying foul over that, and the media gobbling their every protest.&nbsp; Priceless.&nbsp; Or sickening.), but not their SMS restrictions!

Heck, even with [cool providers][2] in Australia, we can&#8217;t get uncapped SMS sending &#8211; admittedly, I&#8217;m only paying 11c to most mobiles (free to others, subject to restrictions also &#8211; certainly not completely unlimited), but it makes you wonder what this guy is complaining about.

He thought the promotion was going to 2010?&nbsp; Bull.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, seems like I&#8217;m rambling on a topic I have no knowledge of &#8211; I don&#8217;t live in NZ, and haven&#8217;t spoken to anyone who does about the whole thing, but seriously &#8211; has ANYONE ever seen a legitimate business make forward looking promotions stretching SEVEN YEARS into the future (this promotion was around since 2003, was meant to expire at the end of that year, but was extended by six months)?

Unbelievable.
