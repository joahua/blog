Heh.&nbsp; I want one.&nbsp; It&#8217;s in whatever language they speak in Brazil, but pictures know no language &#8211; a very cool mod.

If anyone speaks&#8230; Brazilian? post a comment and let me know what it says ;)&nbsp; I could &#8216;fish it, but I&#8217;m at school, and certain proxies won&#8217;t let me access Googles&#8217; translator (or Babelfish, or anything else, for that matter) &#8211; that, and I don&#8217;t trust them with the task of producing anything cohesive.

Judging from this:

> Foi utilizado um Tablet PC Fujitsu Stylistic 1200 em um Boombox Hitachi TRK-8200HR, rodando Windows 98, com placa de rede e webcam embutidos.

I think that means it&#8217;s running on a Tablet PC, running &#8217;98 (wt? As if you wouldn&#8217;t run the OS that came with!), inside an old Hitachi boombox thing.

And then there was something about a webcam&#8230;

I don&#8217;t speak Brazilian.&nbsp; Does it show?
