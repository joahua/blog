Okay, so, as of right about nowish, there are THREE styles employed on this website.

<http://sc.dalegroup.net/?style=1> is the original;  
<http://sc.dalegroup.net/?style=2> is my favorite, Clouds, and;  
<http://sc.dalegroup.net/?style=3> is the original with the "Full post | Comments (number of comments)" thing aligned left.

So, style one for people that aren&#8217;t change addicts.&nbsp; Style two for people who are, or who like clouds more than random CG&#8217;d watery looking grey stuff (I used to think it was cool), and style three for Dale.&nbsp; Hehehe.

Time for you to change that bookmark?
