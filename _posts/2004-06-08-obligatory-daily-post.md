At least, that&#8217;s what it feels like.&nbsp; Sort of.&nbsp; I just went to go to bed, then realised I hadn&#8217;t stuck anything up.

I guess this is sort of a good vent for the day, helps to wind-down and whatever else.&nbsp; On the other hand, I am only able to post the stuff I won&#8217;t mind people reading here, which means that all the crap is left floating in my head&#8230; meh, it&#8217;s nice to have some people share in the little good things that happen, if not here in the form of comments, then in the real world.

A good thing happened today, which I cannot share with the world, because of the not-so-good things surrounding it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m thankful that there were other people there also, so at least there are some people who I can share with and talk to about it&#8230; it&#8217;s kind of like that with many things, but especially in this instance.

With things I *will* freely talk about, however, thanks heaps to everyone who has been kind enough to [comment][1] on my story, both here and on the Dalegroup forums.&nbsp; Especially to Soolie :)
