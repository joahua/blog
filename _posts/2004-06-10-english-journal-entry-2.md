**English Journal Entry #2**  
*Wednesday, June 09, 2004*  
&#8212;&#8211;  
I&#8217;d jotted some notes down on the bus about ideas and whatever else, in terms of what should happen &#8211; obviously, if it&#8217;s going to be recursive, we still need to have stuff happen to make it interesting &#8211; imagine a mirror reflecting into infinity without an image to reflect.

So we got a basic start to it all slammed up, because that is invaluable, just for the sake of getting the ball rolling.&nbsp; I think Tori was writing everything down, and we developed a plot up to the first soliloquy &#8212; and we also established a list of character attributes (and aspects of jealousy associated with these).&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t decide who these attributes would be assigned to, that happens tomorrow.

Essentially, the play starts with us sitting down and saying &#8220;So, what are we going to do for this play?&#8221; &#8211; giving an impression that absolutely NO preparation has gone into it.&nbsp; We start bouncing ideas around, and then hit the one that we&#8217;re going with &#8212; at that point, Tori launches into soliloquy. She doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll work, and is jealous of the apparent confidence of other characters.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve only written down rough notes&#8230; I&#8217;ve borrowed Tori&#8217;s book, and typed + emailed copies of what we have so far to everyone.
