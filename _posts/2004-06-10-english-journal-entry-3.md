**English Journal Entry #3**  
*Thursday, June 10, 2004*  
&#8212;&#8211;  
Today was really productive!&nbsp; We matched people to the roles we developed yesterday, and made minor alterations to our dialog, so that the roles were consistent with the elements of jealousy demonstrated in soliloquies (that is, so everyone has a decent soliloquy which matches their character within the play) &#8212; we managed to throughly confuse ourselves with the idea (perhaps it was too twisted?), but eventually got our heads around it.

There are three types of jealousy demonstrated (thank goodness we had no more people to try and script for!), these being jealousy of confidence/conviction, ideas and imagination, and leadership abilities.&nbsp; Those three roles correspond to Tori, Kim and myself, respectively.

We wrote intermediate dialog (the key features of the play being the soliloquies), decided how we were to end the play, and cemented the basis of what was to be said in our soliloquies.&nbsp; After school, I sat in study hall and scripted what Kim had written today &#8212; she wanted to do her own soliloquy, so there is still a gap where that is to go, but the play is complete with that one exception.

It shall be interesting to see how it all goes, once we rehearse it in its complete form.&nbsp; Due to the nature of it (i.e. we&#8217;re playing ourselves), not much rehearsal is required, which is useful.
