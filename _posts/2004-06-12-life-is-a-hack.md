And sometime, it&#8217;s all going to fall apart&#8230; a new version was released without any forewarning &#8211; suddenly, I&#8217;m running superfluous code, bloated, and in violation of all standards recommendations.

Realworld&trade; hacks?&nbsp; They happen, too.&nbsp; Circuit switched, call it what you will&#8230; most of the time, there is another way to do things.&nbsp; Admittedly, it&#8217;s possible to waste an indefinite amount of time finding these alternative routes to a solution, but that doesn&#8217;t negate their existence.

The [definition][1] of the word "[hack][2]" is something of a source of amusement.&nbsp; Broad application?&nbsp; Oh yeah.&nbsp; I suppose one can say they hack without fear of people suspecting anything, given the magnitude of that list.&nbsp; What kind of hacker are you?&nbsp; Will your hacks still work with the next version of&#8230; Life?
