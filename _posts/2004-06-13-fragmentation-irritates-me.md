But what the hell, I&#8217;ll respond here, anyway.&nbsp; Dale, hurry up and get a commenting system!

In response to the entry on his front page (as of 13/06/04 &#8211; no permalink available), entitled "The truth behind open source, closed source and anything in between."

Specifically, in response to comments made with regard to the Fedora distribution of the Linux OS; Fedora, whilst officially a technology release, holds technological advancement as a priority ([objective #5][1]) &#8211; this, if not adequately tested, may result in instability and a product which is NOT usable by the wider community (hence in conflict with objective #1).

This is something of an occasional neccessity &#8211; they are (so it would seem) locked down by their incredibly tight development schedule, as a result of this being an established requirement of the Fedora team (presumably in order to permit Red Hat to fully evaluate technologies in advance, with a wide-testing audience, in order to ensure the continued quality of its&#8217; commercial offerings).

That said, it is perfectly reasonable for Red Hat to NOT offer software support for this distribution &#8211; such is the nature of Open Source.&nbsp; It is not financially viable for Red Hat to offer [any formal level of] support to users of Fedora, as Fedora *is a technology release, released free of charge to the community*.&nbsp; This IS very much beta-quality software.&nbsp; I am sitting here on a FC1 desktop &#8211; I have been using this as my primary operating environment since the beginning of the year, and Red Hat 9 before then.&nbsp; It *is* usable, in the same way any Beta-quality software is usable.&nbsp; Rough edges, occasionally, but not typical of the finished product (or the development model!).

In the same way the Apache organisation co-ordinates the development of its various product offerings (we&#8217;ll stick to HTTPD for the sake of argument), Red Hat and other distribution development organisations are similarly responsible for the co-ordination of their respective developments.

The fundamental difference between Apache and Red Hat is the nature of their "flagship" product.&nbsp; Apache doesn&#8217;t *have* a flagship product (they are best known for their&nbsp; HTTPD engine, but if you visit <http://www.apache.org> it is evident that there is a wider range of software available and being developed under the Apache product, all of which is equally promoted, regardless as to market share/penetration or apparent application), whilst Red Hat do.&nbsp; RHEL carries SLA&#8217;s, stability, and a price-tag.&nbsp; Apache HTTPD carries none of the above, and functions perfectly well (on something like 60% of the worlds&#8217; publicly-accessible web servers).

So what is "different" (and therefore, presumably, wrong) about the development model employed by Red Hat?&nbsp; To put it bluntly, they are attempting to balance priorities of bringing a commercial product to market, whilst simultaneously attempting to provide a completely open derivative within established time constaints.&nbsp; Conceptually, Fedora is supposed to be a software breeding ground, for integration into RHEL when it reaches maturity.&nbsp; Realistically?&nbsp; Fedora is a testing ground.&nbsp; They do release products to schedule (I would argue that this is their failing point).&nbsp; And components do eventually become integrated into RHEL products as they reach maturity.

What was wrong with FC2?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know &#8211; I haven&#8217;t used it (haha, I have a GB or two of ISO&#8217;s sitting there still un-burnt).&nbsp; In a comparison such as the one Dale claims to be making, I strongly object to any complaints made about the boot-loader issue.&nbsp; When you show me ANY Windows OS boot-loaders that will support a non-MS platform (heck, one that didn&#8217;t overwrite the MBR by default would do me fine!), I&#8217;ll heed your compliants.&nbsp; Until then, write to Microsoft about it asking them to resolve the problem.

Because you can&#8217;t modify that part of the Windows installer yourself.&nbsp; Something to do with closed source concepts, perhaps?
