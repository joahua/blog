I was @[swylie][1]&#8216;s today, doing various stuff, and saw an incredibly cool camera.&nbsp; Gimmicky in parts, but still undeniably functional and generally cool.&nbsp; I \*think\* it was a Sony [DCR-TRV950][2] MiniDV cam, but wasn&#8217;t taking notes&#8230; if you read this, Steve, feel free to correct ;)

The image quality was drool-worthy (3CCD&#8217;s do that), with a full colour(!) eyepiece, as well as an enormous flip-out screen (if the camera is the TRV950, then it&#8217;s officially 3.5" &#8211; bloody huge, compared to all other handheld camera screens I&#8217;ve seen, at any rate) which is touch sensitive and comes complete with stylus!!&nbsp; It was kind of scary, though &#8211; I kept thinking I was going to poke a hole in the screen&#8230; was the only un-cool thing about the whole experience.

As for the gimmicks?&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; Bluetooth.&nbsp; Need I say more?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Thankyou.&nbsp; Network streaming over Bluetooth is blatantly ridiculous, especially on what is meant to be a prosumer class camera.&nbsp; That said, I wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing how it worked, just as a once off.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t see it being great quality, seeing the throughput of Bluetooth is apparently less than 750Kbps, as opposed to the enourmous powah of Firewire (or i.Link, as Sony insists on calling it) at 400Mbps, but still&#8230; it&#8217;d make for a cool tech demo.

Long story short?&nbsp; I want one&#8230;
