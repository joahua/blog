Well, for the first time ever, I left a session open too long, and it ate my cookie.&nbsp; WHO STOLE THE COOKIE FROM THE COOKIE JAR?!?!!?

I want my cookie back :(&nbsp; It&#8217;s kind of funny.&nbsp; I type up stuff, and give up caring as soon as I type it.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t really think that this is a great outlet, because I&#8217;m careful about what I type (publicly accessible websites are a little like that), but trying to make myself type what I&#8217;d lost requires concious effort.&nbsp; More a reflection of my laziness than anything else, perhaps?&nbsp; Ah well.

I&#8217;m combatting my laziness for a bit.

Three assessments happened today, most of which I was happy with.&nbsp; Well, all of which I was happy with, at an individual level.&nbsp; English, Business and a Cisco final exam.

English?&nbsp; It was a group performance task, and we all performed pretty well, and had prepared&#8230; enough.&nbsp; But the plot was somewhat lost in the space between our scripts and the audience.&nbsp; Or so I think&#8230; Tori would have me believe otherwise, but hey.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;ll do okay, so no major gripes there.

I&#8217;m not so happy about that assessment in general, though, due to the content of a certain other performance.&nbsp; At risk of making it worse, I won&#8217;t elaborate here.&nbsp; Bullying, or at least defamation, which of course passed undetected by the teacher for various reasons.&nbsp; Somewhat angry about that one, in fact.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll stop talking now.

Business was a report on Sydney Tower Restaurants, which I had done very little preparation for (save a quick Google the night before), for various reasons &#8211; I bothered to write a report scaffold on the bus on my way in to school this morning, though, which was mildly invaluable.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy with the assessment, although I didn&#8217;t get time to finish completely.&nbsp; I used two booklets, and the last two pages are scrawled dot-point notes, because I realised I had a little too much to cover with five minutes to go ;)

The Cisco Semester 1 Final Exam, I managed to scrape in with a beautiful 73.9 &#8211; a pass is 70 &#8211; which was immensely cool.&nbsp; I was meant to sit that one last Friday, but due to "preparing for English" (meaning, that is what I was doing, but it was highly unproductive&#8230; had fun drawing dyslexic flutterbyes, though) I didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; Which, in retrospect, is almost definitely a Good Thing&trade; &#8211; I sat it this afternoon in the company of Year 12, who are infinitely more quiet than the year 11 cohort ever are ;)&nbsp; Hehe, the funny thing is, they thought they were making too much noise.&nbsp; You guys rock.

As promised to various people, my english script:

### English script {#engscript}

*Costume: School uniforms  
Setting: SACS classroom  
Time of day: Normal school times  
Props + aids: Table, three chairs, paper + books, signs &#8212; &#8220;The Next Day&#8221;, &#8220;The Day Before Performance&#8221;, &#8220;Performance Day&#8221;*

Kim:  
Can we start, sir?

\*teacher response\*  
Josh:  
Hmm&#8230; so, what are we going to do for this thing?  
K:  
I dunno.  
Tori:  
Can we NOT do some dodgy love triangle soap opera?  
K:  
Just &#8217;cause you&#8217;re insecure about your love life.  
J:  
How about we satirise the whole &#8220;school leadership&#8221; thing?  
T:  
Yeah&#8230; but would we get marked down for humour?  
\*Tori is stabbing table with pen mindlessly\*  
J:  
What are the criteria?  
\*checks sheet\*  
It doesn&#8217;t say you can&#8217;t.  
To Tori: What did the table ever do to you?  
K:  
To Tori: Could you please not? I&#8217;m trying to write!  
T:  
\*Tori moves book onto lap, continues mindless stabbing\*  
Any better?  
K:  
\*glares at Tori\*  
J:  
To Kim: Hey, you should write shorthand.  
To all: Hmm&#8230; but if we did the leadership thing, we&#8217;d have to make sure we didn&#8217;t attack anyone personally.  
T:  
Just because we say &#8220;school captain&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean we mean OUR school captains!  
J:  
Yeah, okay.  
\*looks at Kim, who is writing constantly on her notepad\*  
Hey Kim, writing all this down?  
K:  
Most of it.  
T:  
Sooo&#8230; Do you think we can do this without being bitchy?  
J:  
Probably&#8230; not.  
Oh! We could do a whole play where we are jealous of each others roles in the play!&nbsp; Like, we think other people have better parts than ourselves&#8230; and stuff&#8230;  
T:  
THAT&#8217;S SO COOL!!! We could be all arty!  
K:  
What &#8211; just be ourselves and have monologues?  
J:  
Yeah, kinda.&nbsp; It&#8217;d be about us writing this play&#8211; so crazily recursive stuff!  
T:  
It&#8217;d be cool&#8230;  
\*hesitates slightly\*  
&#8230;if we can get it to work.  
J:  
Yeah, it&#8217;d suck if we got up and everyone just gave us blank looks when we finished.  
K:  
But if we do it well &#8212; hey, this could work!

*1st Monologue starts here.*&nbsp; T. stands, K. and J. freeze in background.&nbsp; T. walks to front of performance area, and sits on a chair.

I don&#8217;t think this could work. It&#8217;s so complicated!&nbsp; We barely understand it, how are we going to make other people get it?&nbsp; We won&#8217;t do well if no-one understands what we&#8217;re going on about.&nbsp; I wish I had their confidence. They&#8217;re so sure that it&#8217;s a good idea.&nbsp; This all comes so easy for them.

T. walks back to K. and J., and sits down again.&nbsp; She freezes, and then all unfreeze.&nbsp; Dialog recommences.

T:  
Yeah, okay.  
\*sounds enthusiastic, a slight edge to voice &#8212; passes un-noticed by K. and J., but clear to audience (i.e. follow-on from soliloquy)\*  
K:  
We should probably finish up, Mr. Sandon wants us to pay attention.  
J:  
Kim, are you going to type up those notes?&nbsp; We actually have a practical USE for them now!  
K:  
See, I knew we would!  
T:  
Cool.&nbsp; Give us copies of the notes, okay?  
K:  
Sure, I&#8217;ll give you copies tomorrow.  
All &#8220;exit&#8221;  
The next day&#8211;in English.  
Someone to hold up card, announcing this. (i.e. says &#8220;The Next Day&#8221;)  
K:  
Hey everybody, here&#8217;s the thing from yesterday  
\*distributes sheet with note written on\*  
\*Tori stabs herself in the eye with a pen&#8211; okay, perhaps that wasn&#8217;t meant to be scripted\*  
J:  
You have waay too much spare time!  
\*all read script for about 10-20 seconds\*  
T:  
Hey, this is good.&nbsp; Thanks for writing this up.  
K:  
Yeah, there were some good ideas in there

*2nd Monologue starts here.*&nbsp; K. stands, T. and J. freeze in background.&nbsp; K. walks to front of performance area, and sits on a chair.

Why does he always have the good ideas?  
Wasn&#8217;t it my idea to write all this down anyway?

I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m getting jealous over ideas about jealousy.

I don&#8217;t want to admit it, but there are some great ideas in there that we should really look at using: like satirising the whole school leadership thing and being jealous of other peoples parts in a play.

I wish I could come up with ideas like that.

K. walks back to T. and J., and sits down again.&nbsp; She freezes, and then all unfreeze.&nbsp; Dialog recommences.  
T:  
So, we should probably start writing our script, hey?  
K :  
\*somewhat grudgingly&#8211;not noticed by T or J, evident to audience\*  
Yeah, there are some good ideas we could use in there.  
J:  
Okay, let&#8217;s get to work.  
All &#8220;exit&#8221;

Day before performance.  
Someone to hold up card, announcing this. (i.e. says &#8220;The Day Before Performance.&#8221;)  
T:  
Did everyone practice their parts?  
J:  
\*kind of reluctant\* Yes&#8230;  
K:  
C&#8217;mon guys! I know we can make this work heaps well!! Show some enthusiasm. It&#8217;ll be heaps of fun!!

*3rd and final Monologue starts here.*&nbsp; J. stands, K. and T. freeze in background.&nbsp; J. walks to front of performance area, and sits on a chair.

\*Looks at Kim\* How can she be so&#8230; enthusiastic?

It&#8217;s kind of ironic, actually.&nbsp; In preparing for a play about a play about jealousy, I wind up being all insecure about it&#8230; insecurity was meant to be an attribute behind jealousy, wasn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; See, we don&#8217;t even understand what we&#8217;re meant to be performing!&nbsp; Her confidence&#8230; 

And Tori&#8211; she seemed a little reluctant at first, maybe I&#8217;m just paranoid about acceptance of ideas; but she is really good at just getting things done &#8212; I wish that I were able to do that.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a good leader.

J. walks back to T. and K., and sits down again.&nbsp; He freezes, and then all unfreeze.&nbsp; Dialog recommences.  
J:  
So&#8230; umm&#8230; how about we practice our scripts again?  
K:  
Yeah, good idea!  
All &#8220;exit&#8221;  
Performance Day..  
Someone to hold up card, announcing this. (i.e. says &#8220;Performance Day&#8221;)  
K:  
Can we start, sir?
