Hmm.&nbsp; I just printed out cover pages, two drafts, the final copy, and a compositional reflection thingamajig, and it came to 22 pages total.

Doo bee doo.

So much for 1000 words&#8230; \*cough\*.

Yes, of course my final limit is within the 1100 mark!!&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t dream of violating that!&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t be so irresponsible as to write 1500ish words even on the final edit.

I shall say no more.&nbsp; ;)

The final copy shall be posted online after I return home tomorrow afternoon, as without a doubt, there will be many people still working on it tonight and tomorrow morning, and making their life easier would be boring.&nbsp; Or something.&nbsp; Plagurism sucks, hehe.

I suppose they \*did\* ask it be double spaced, so that unneccessarily contributed some significant bloat to the final document, but still&#8230; 22 pages for ~1500 words seems ridiculous.&nbsp; Meh!
