A cool new initiative by [Dalegroup][1], this is kind of like the iiNet Zoo, only more skillful ;)

Well, sort of.&nbsp; Skillful by virtue of the people it is being promoted to &#8211; linkage on [Whirlpool][2] and Dalegroup [Forums][3]. ;)

Check it out here: <http://iinet.dalegroup.net/>

I&#8217;m currently working on a backend for it, which will allow dynamic adding, editing, removal conveniences &#8211; and, more importantly, SEARCH CAPABILITIES!!!

My goodness.&nbsp; That is something this website has been missing for a while now!&nbsp; Massively up there on my to-do list for the holidays!&nbsp; It shouldn&#8217;t even take too long &#8211; it&#8217;s just never been a priority.&nbsp; Holidays are looking full already.&nbsp; This is not cool!

Three weeks is not enough.&nbsp; I have no more assessments due this term, having handed in the Extension task&#8230; hmmm \*contemplates disappearing for the next few days until school breaks up\*.

Tempting, but parentals have never taken too kindly to that type of thing.
