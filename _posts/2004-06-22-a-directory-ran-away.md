Possibly with the dish and the spoon.&nbsp; Although more likely a journaling file system which has issues.&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; Yeah, I lost my shop files for this website&#8230; fortunately the only stuff I hadn&#8217;t stored on the Dalegroup mirror was high resolution stock &#8211; which I can download again if I ever decide I need it ;)

Irritating, nonetheless.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m currently leeching my code back from Dalegroup.&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; Leeching back.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t remember were I read it, but this story just came to mind about some guy who downloaded a song off (Insert P2P network name here), and then once he&#8217;d finished downloading the user he got it off started downloading the same song off him.&nbsp; Aforementioned P2P network has user-chat capabilities, and when the user is asked what he/she/it is downloading the song back for, the reply was "Stealing my song back, you bastard!".

There was a tenuous link, at least in my mind ;)

[iiCommunity][1] backend is chugging along slowly.&nbsp; User-side interface is done, just banging up an admin panel now (the slow bit;), and then it&#8217;ll be released.
