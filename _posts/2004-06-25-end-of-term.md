Yay.&nbsp; Man I am so up for holidays&#8230; right now I can&#8217;t see them lasting long enough!!&nbsp; I spent the last two and a bit days doing a whole lot of not very much, between [Showcase Concert][1] (which was fairly average, apparently levering on cute-factor rather than professionalism or quality to draw an audience) and a development session for the best part of today&#8230; and avoiding Galah Day in the process.

Ooops.&nbsp; ;)

So that was interesting.&nbsp; And astoundingly unproductive, but hey, I don&#8217;t really care!&nbsp; Completely over attending classes and/or school stuff anyway (showcase doesn&#8217;t count as school stuff, just for the record ;) ), at this end of the term.&nbsp; Especially when half the school isn&#8217;t in classes either, hehe.&nbsp; Peer pressure and all that. :p

In other exciting news, Tori&#8217;s website is finally live over @ <http://toriworld.tk/>.&nbsp; Not a whole lot there yet, but at least it&#8217;s finally public, so perhaps updates will start pouring onto the website for the entertainment of the ConnectedMasses&trade;!!&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; "w00t" ;)&nbsp; Should I append &trade; to that also?

Woooooo holidays!!!&nbsp; The Edge camp is happening this weekend, which is going to be very cool I hope&#8230; theme of the year is PIRATES!&nbsp; I&#8217;m assured people are bringing cameras, so photos will most probably be published on [Ben&#8217;s][2] website sometime.&nbsp; To all who aren&#8217;t going/can&#8217;t go, gonna miss you!

Back in a few days, possibly sooner if I try and do something stupid like update this page via WAP.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;d work, because I use cookies for sessions management, so unless my phone supports cookies I can&#8217;t login to my CMS panel.&nbsp; It might, it might&#8230;&nbsp; but it&#8217;s probably not worth the effort to type with a phone keypad, let alone the cost ;)
