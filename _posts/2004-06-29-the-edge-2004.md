A VERY exciting time!!!&nbsp; My cookie was again swallowed (note to self &#8211; increase timeout on that one) so a larger, better worded post has been lost in the void, so here is an abridged version!

A whole heap of people became Christian and a whole heap more were encouraged by that and by each other!&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; No matter how long I try to write, I can&#8217;t capture how amazing this is on paper!&nbsp; My favorite passage that we studied over the last four days is this:

> **Philippians 3:7-11**
> 
> But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.&nbsp; What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things.&nbsp; I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ&nbsp; and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ&#8211;the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.&nbsp; I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.

It&#8217;s kinda chunky, but hey &#8211; so incredibly cool!

It was absolutely great, you could see God at work in the lives of people there so clearly &#8211; Ashley Kurrle being one amazing example which I know of, as well as others in other year groups.&nbsp; Thanks SACS ministry team!&nbsp; God is using you to change lives!

I&#8217;m rambling a little &#8211; I&#8217;d better stop, or I&#8217;ll loose more cookies, and then problems happen!&nbsp; Haha.&nbsp; What else?&nbsp; Ben&#8217;s 17th birthday was yesterday!&nbsp; Happy Birthday Ben!!!&nbsp; Soo&#8230; I guess that means Nikky Webster is also seventeen, as of a few months ago? ;)
