Phwoar.&nbsp; I just heard the most insane mix of Evanescence&#8217;s *Hello* on DI.fm Vocal Trance.&nbsp; The song in itself is pretty haunting, so it did lend itself to a genre which is traditionally heavy on high reverb times, but I was more impressed by the fact that it didn&#8217;t just SUCK.&nbsp; Look at the atrocity which is the Radio Edit of *My Immortal*! I paid for their album, *Fallen*, which apparently entitles me to a free download of the &#8220;Band Version&#8221; (as they insist on calling it&#8230; I&#8217;d go for &#8220;Mass-Audiences-are-Stupid&trade; version&#8221;, instead &#8211; but then, I probably don&#8217;t work in marketing for a reason), which I have declined.

I&#8217;m still not over how much the radio edit of that track sucked. Bleh! Anyway. The vocal trance version of Hello was seriously sweet, especially after you consider it wasn&#8217;t done in-house &#8211; that is, without access to original tracks and other such useful things. So yeah. That&#8217;s my randomness for the day over ;)

What else? Oh. Saw Dawn of the Dead last night with Ben and Tori &#8211; it was kind of like 28 Days Later, only probably produced on a much higher budget (28 Days Later was a film grant production, but it didn&#8217;t really show, aside from the fact that it was shot on digital rather than telecine &#8211; even then, they claim it was a deliberate stylistic decision rather than the result of any budget constraints). Oh, and it was more gory and less suspenseful (if that is a word &#8211; if not, it is now) than 28 Days Later&#8230; that said, it was hilarious at times, although whether this is an inherent attribute of the film itself, or simply a by-product of the audience and company I saw it in is something which I&#8217;ll leave for someone else to decide!
