The two are completely unrelated, don&#8217;t worry ;)

The gimmick?&nbsp; It is a [fishtank][1] which is USB powered, from ELX.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; And you thought the mug warmer was bad.

And the statistics?&nbsp; Well, it&#8217;s the end of the first month this website has been fully functional &#8211; so semi-valid numbers for once ;)

*Unique visitors:* 203  
*Number of visits:* 366 (1.8 visits/visitor)  
*Pages:* 7183 (19.62 pages/visit)  
*Hits:* 11009 (30.07 hits/visit)

Somewhat unsuprisingly, the day with the highest number of hits co-incided with the day after Whirlpool heard about [iiCommunity][2] &#8211; traffic wasn&#8217;t sustained, though &#8211; it dropped down to normal levels the day after that.

Hits, by Operating System that they came from:  
*Windows:* 55.2 %  
*Linux:* 42.7 %  
*Macintosh:* 1.3 %

And by web browser:  
*Mozilla:* 59.8 %  
*Some Flavour of Internet Explorer:* 33.4 %  
*Opera:* 2.9 %  
and *Netscape*, coming in at a lowly 1.4%.

What other interesting stats are there?&nbsp; Umm&#8230; Okay.&nbsp; The day of the highest bandwidth usage co-incided with the release of the first draft of my Imaginative Composition &#8211; hehe, but it wasn&#8217;t that huge &#8211; chances are it was the public release of multiple-styles on that same day which was responsible for drumming up the traffic ;)

Ah well.&nbsp; Next challenge: get some real content, get PageRank listings, sustain hits for the next month!&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; I have two weeks of holidays left in which to do various stuff, so perhaps I&#8217;ll squeeze in some coding time for this website.

It&#8217;s not holding the same interest anymore, though.&nbsp; I mean&#8230; I enjoy it, in the problem-solving sense.&nbsp; But only when a problem is defined and there are clear expectations and outcomes, not when I&#8217;m just randomly adding features to my website.

So, to define a need &#8211; some kind of file-storage thing!&nbsp; Because people ask to see originals of various documents (e.g. that short story "Blurred Reality"), and it&#8217;s easier to preserve formatting and other such things in PDF&#8217;s than it is just copying text into a webform!&nbsp; Well, that is one thing I want to work on.

What do other people think?&nbsp; What else does this site need?&nbsp; The document organisation thing would essesntially fulfil the waiting "Projects" sections purpose, so don&#8217;t say that.

I think something to show the most recent comments (ala Platform 7 front page) would be useful, although my design is too narrow to do that well&#8230; perhaps another redesign?

Use the comments thing, tell me what sucks most about this site, or is missing, or whatever!
