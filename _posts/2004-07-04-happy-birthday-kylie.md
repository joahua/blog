And lots of stuff like that!&nbsp; Woo.&nbsp; Hope you had a great day :)

I spent last night @ the Cat&#8217;s residence (a.k.a. the [Cat-man][1]) watching a movie called "The Whole Nine Yards".&nbsp; Hehe, I watched TV!&nbsp; Wow!

Also been spending time burning up the bandwidth as much as possible streaming stuff, especially off [TheBasement][2].&nbsp; Any particular reason?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve decided that, just like the rest of iiNet apparently sees a need to, I must download as much as possible just beacuse I&#8217;m allocated ridiculous amounts of quota by my&#8230; generous ISP.&nbsp; Who, just for the record, currently have a distinct lack of functioning international links, whilst WestNet, Pacific, Telstra (who is being blamed for the outage) and miscellaneous other ISP&#8217;s are functioning perfectly (how do I know this?&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; I&#8217;m listening to streaming music live from the US via a Pacific relay, surfing the internet using a Telstra proxy, resolving hosts using a TPG DNS server (iiNets went out, again), and Whirlpool reports WestNet as working fine.)

To be fair, iiNet have been decent for the last month or three, but still&#8230; UNCOOL.
