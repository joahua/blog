The following was posted on Whirlpool several minutes ago:

> Well, I&#8217;m on 512 Lite, and have finally resigned myself to the fact that there is no hope (in the near future) of getting a speed upgrade at the same pricepoint, even if it meant getting less quota than I have now (note, it is still pre-July 12).
> 
> As shocking as it may seem, I struggle to use even four GB (not four GB on/off peak, four GB altogether) a month. I&#8217;m now faced with the wonderous prospect of being able to download SO MUCH MORE! Wow! 24GB of quota to burn!!!
> 
> The only thing is, well&#8230; I&#8217;m at a bit of a loss as to how to use it. So, with this in mind, I turn to the Whirlpool iiNet community for help! My ambition for the next month is to GET CAPPED! Yes, that&#8217;s right. I want to be capped. Not because I&#8217;ll enjoy the sensation of slightly > dialup speeds, but simply because I&#8217;m a stubborn prick who desires to prove a point.
> 
> In order to achieve this, I need lots of NON-BLIINKZONE content to download! I don&#8217;t do pirated stuff, or pr0n, but all other content will be DOWNLOADED!
> 
> I invite other iiNet users who are similarly confused as to how to use this amazing new product improvement to join me in bringing the iiNetwork to a grinding halt&#8230; or, at least putting a dent in iiNet&#8217;s bandwidth bill. Sure, it is probably insignificant to an organisation of their size, especially seeing iiNet&#8217;s customer base is far broader than the couple of hundred who read/post on Whirlpool, but it brings a feeling of slight satisfaction.

> One other thing &#8211; if you&#8217;re going to list links, make them links to places that won&#8217;t be hurt by people leeching gigabytes off them&#8230; for example, LinuxISO.org (yes, I know it&#8217;s supported by advertisers&#8230; so far as I can see, that&#8217;s just banner ads &#8211; I&#8217;d rather not add to their bandwidth bill unless it is neccesary) and other websites like it.

Here&#8217;s hoping a mod doesn&#8217;t take it down &#8212; we could get an interesting list of content happening.

*Later:*  
Yay! Recognition! My thread was deleted by MM himself! Hmm. Perhaps it did have potential to cause problems! Wahoo!

I&#8217;m feeling elated. The few posts I did see before it was taken down were largely supportive, with the exception of a few by Pythonisman&#8230; he described it as &#8220;silly&#8221; &#8211; which I fully acknowledged &#8211; it is perhaps a little ironic that MM listed &#8220;Silly thread&#8221; as the reason for deletion.

The following was sent in a Whim to MM in response to the locking:

> Deleted and not locked? Ooooh. Potential to cause damage, perhaps&#8230;  
> Teeheehee. Of course it was silly. I just think your changes are silly also&#8230; yup, I don&#8217;t have the numbers, but I have internet resources which have been paid for to use as I please, which, unfortunately for you guys, extends to include pointlessly downloading gigabytes of anything just because I can.
