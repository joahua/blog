Hmm.&nbsp; Spent the last few days doing miscellaneous things, like watching movies with cool people and paying out Playschool with other cool people ;-) Oh, and randomly carrying popcorn-making machines around the place, whilst dodging terror&#8230; erm&#8230; tourists photo-taking skillz.

So yeah.&nbsp; Just before embarking on that particular stint of randomness, I discovered I was an alien, and finished downloading SuSE (or is it SUSE now? I can&#8217;t remember) 9.1 &#8211; an aliens prospective OS of choice, it would seem. In addition to distributing the ISO to various other alien-types, I also burnt myself a copy to CD&#8230; and now prepare to abandon the earthlings Fedora, moving instead to the Prussians preferred distribution (no, that&#8217;s *not* Knoppix, sorry).

Whilst installing SuSE, which will commence immediately after making this post and installing a second graphics card, I \*will\* be using Knoppix for my temporary platform, however.

Praying nothing goes too horribly wrong&#8230;
