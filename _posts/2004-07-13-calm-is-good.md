Ahhhhhhhhhhh.&nbsp; The blissful sound of Apache working.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t say anything.&nbsp; That&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s SILENT!&nbsp; Admittedly, it made no noise before, but hey&#8230; all is good!&nbsp; IT WORKS!!!

The problem?&nbsp; Yeah, it was yet another PEBKAC error&#8230; that said, I&#8217;m still a little peeved at SuSE &#8211; the reason I screwed up was simply because I misesd a very simple detail amongst all the Include&#8217;ings of other files&#8230; by default, their httpd.conf denies access to the entire filesystem.&nbsp; Wonderful!&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; It&#8217;s working now, so I&#8217;m happy :)

Only one thing left to setup, and that&#8217;s Samba and my wonderful WORKING HP printer!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; You have no idea how sexy a test page can look until you struggle with a printer for a few hours&#8230; a few re-compilations later and all was good.&nbsp; Sharing is caring, though, and apparently that is also going to chew my time.

Before I sit down and hack at that one, though, I think I&#8217;ll kick back to some random interface tweaking, simply because I can, and it&#8217;s something which is relaxing &#8211; yes, relaxing!&nbsp; Hehehehehe.

I&#8217;m a geek, watcha going to do about it?
