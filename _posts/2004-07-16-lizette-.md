I was listening to [radio.wazee][1] today, and heard an incredibly cool song by a band called [Lizette &][2].&nbsp; Yeah, weird name, but very cool music &#8211; this is proof that streaming radio is more effective in music promotion than conventional radio &#8211; with the exception of new digital broadcast services (none of which have reached maturity here in Australia, I don&#8217;t think&#8230;), no broadcast radio also transmits track information!

Anyway.&nbsp; This particular track, called "This is (Dark green edition)", was available for download from the wazee website, as well as the original mix (which I&#8217;ve got to say, I prefer) of the song.&nbsp; I lost the link, and can&#8217;t be bothered searching for it again (I&#8217;ve got it mirrored locally in my storage directory if anyone wishes to hear it&#8230; send me an email or something), but bottom line is if I had a credit card, I would have purchased the album by now!

An international CD reseller for their CD, "This is" (the song I heard was the title track), [CD Baby][3], has a playlist of all tracks on the album available for your listening pleasure&#8230; although the tracks aren&#8217;t full length.&nbsp; High quality ones are at a decent bit-rate, at least ;)

They&#8217;re my Band-Of-The-Moment!
