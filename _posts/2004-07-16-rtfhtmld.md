I&#8217;ve been hacking a JavaScript dropdown menu for a client&#8217;s site on and off over the last few days, but only finally sat down with a view to fixing the crazy thing this evening. My goodness. You know those moments where you kick yourself so hard you pity the chair you were sitting in? Okay, so I sit in front of my computer too much, but you get the point. This is like&#8230; ouch. ARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!! Calm is good.

A note, for anyone who is looking to implement not-overly-documented dropdown menus &#8211; read your base source file in its *entirety* before even contemplating trying to implement. It was *two lines*. Two bloody lines of JavaScript which turned into a ~1 hour nightmare search &#8211; not to mention time which I haven&#8217;t counted, because it was hackish, not goal-oriented coding. Of course, the longer spent, the more it hurts to find out exactly what I&#8217;d missed.

      var ddmx = new DropDownMenuX('topnav');
      ddmx.init();

Those two lines. So much pain!

Oh, and just to clear up any confusion, the acronym which is the title of this news post ends in D, for &#8220;Document&#8221;. Not &#8220;dotcom&#8221; or anything stupid like that ;)
