Yay!&nbsp; Check it out @ <http://nicktangents.is-a-geek.com/info/phpsysinfo-dev/> whenever my computer is turned on.&nbsp; It was all easy once I read the QUICKSTART file, hehe.&nbsp; Yes, I did still need the kernel sources.

Was just a matter of compiling, installing, running sensors-detect, senors -s and copying a few files so it does stuff at boot time!&nbsp; Cool program, very cool.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re a Linux-ite, check out <http://www2.lm-sensors.nu/~lm78/> for yourself.&nbsp; Worth having ;)
