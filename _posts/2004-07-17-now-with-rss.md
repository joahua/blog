Not that I&#8217;d ever be one to follow a trend, but you know&#8230; these things happen.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got an RSS feed running @ <http://sc.dalegroup.net/rss-2.0.php> for all who are interested.

I&#8217;ve taken an "embrace and extend" approach to it, though &#8211; I&#8217;m hoping that those I was influenced by in implementing RSS will take note of the new feature I&#8217;ve added, and enhance theirs accordingly!&nbsp; In addition to feeding the title of the post, and the first 128 characters (rounded up to the nearest complete word) of the body, my feed also denotes the number of comments.

Not that that is a particularly useful feature on a website such as this, though &#8211; I get hardly any comments, which is sad :(&nbsp; But hey!&nbsp; That&#8217;s not what this is about&#8230; I&#8217;m hoping other people will also add this to their RSS title so that I can see at a glance in Ximian if people have commented on a particular post.

Enjoy&#8230; comment more&#8230; speak Dutch&#8230;
