Having nearly missed a [comment][1] from the incrrrrrrrrreeedibly cool Tomas from [Lizette &][2], but for being notified by two people who DO watch my normal RSS feed (their readers are stuffed and don&#8217;t handle my updating comments number too well&#8230; long story &#8211; bottom line is, they know when new comments are posted, the rest of the world doesn&#8217;t), I decided it&#8217;d be somewhat valuable to have a comments monitoring feed.

So that&#8217;s what I coded. <http://sc.dalegroup.net/rss-2.0-comments.php> is it, so if you care, add it to your syndication list. If no-one else uses it, I don&#8217;t really care:p I will be! Hehe.

By the way, I&#8217;m still getting over a guy from a band I like actually coming and posting on my website. It&#8217;s a bit trippy! Lizette & aren&#8217;t exactly a household name (yet ;)), but still! Very cool, don&#8217;t know too many other bands that&#8217;d take the time to do that. You guys rock.

Hehe, AND, if you post more comments, I&#8217;ll even know about it straight away this time around!

**EDIT:**  
If feeds aren&#8217;t working, click the two following links and email me the errors &#8211; if there are no errors, it&#8217;s your RSS reader:
