I decided at around lunchtime today that Sydney is the new Alaska. Random MSN conversations whilst doing &#8220;data entry&#8221; are an enthralling way to pass time&#8230; hehe. That&#8217;s about the only relevance of the news title to this post, although I still maintain it to be true. Tori was wearing 6 layers, not counting the cat worn (or endured?) as a scarf (n.b. I assume the cat was still alive. The LIVE cat was the scarf, she hadn&#8217;t killed one, so no-one go calling the RSPCA;)), whilst I was in an uberly heated office, yet still wearing 4&#8230; that means it&#8217;s cold, by my reckoning.

In my procrastination today, I discovered a cool app in PC Authority which is kind of like Bochs, only actually fastish.&nbsp; Apparently. I couldn&#8217;t get it to compile out-of-the-box on my SuSE baby, but I&#8217;ll tinker with some libraries and compile options later, and post if a) I remember to and b) It&#8217;s worth &#8220;writing home&#8221; about.

The application is called qemu, and can be found at <http://bellard.org/qemu/> (redirects to a freehost) to anyone who cares to look. Just for the record, there ARE versions available for Windows, so don&#8217;t go calling me an elitist Linux snob who only cares about Linux software. Just think it. Because it&#8217;s true. I couldn&#8217;t give a stuff about Windows software, unless it does something incredibly cool that I haven&#8217;t been able to do for years over here ;)

Yeah. This thing is being touted as the OSS VMWare alternative in PCAU, so we&#8217;ll see what transpires in days to come, I&#8217;d imagine.

Anyway. Enough about emulation platforms which may or may not work on my computer. There&#8217;s a lot to be said for pre-compiled software that just works, you know ;) (note to the clueless &#8211; not pre-compiled software with a fifteen page list of depedencies. I don&#8217;t enjoy that.). That, however, doesn&#8217;t appear on my newly released [wishlist][1], because really, it&#8217;d take half the fun out of running Linux.&nbsp; I might experience an increase in productivity!

Hmm. Productivity == achieved wishlist. Perhaps I *should* add binaries that JustWork&trade; to that list&#8230;

Anyway, take a look at it, even if just for fun. It&#8217;s all geek stuff, but that&#8217;s not the whole list&#8230; I was thinking in geek-mode when that list was written, tis all ;)
