On what is meant to be a week working in an IT environment, I spent the day climbing on the roofs of some of the oldest buildings in Australia (completed 1862).&nbsp; And, better still, I was equipped with an incredbily sexy Sony DSC-P10 digital camera whilst doing so.

Of course, this meant I had to get Gallery up and running to share it all with the world, so check out <http://nicktangents.is-a-geek.com/gallery/> for the images (server running on my desktop, so accessible only when my PC is turned on).&nbsp; What you see there was the result of a ~1 and a half hour trip, and an FTP upload to my home PC of an 80MB ZIP file.&nbsp; Hehehe.&nbsp; Not all of the images were relevant, there were originally 66.&nbsp; I removed the more boring ones of scaffolding from view (the scaffolding shots were my justification for the trip).

They let me onto the roof of the Quadrangle building, the Mungo MacCallum building, and the Bell Tower (that last one is like&#8230; "no-one goes here" territory.&nbsp; Mind you, not too many tourists go on roofs, but you get the idea.) &#8211; hence my desire for extensive photo-evidence of my trip ;)&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; It was 66 photos, the album contains 38 (the rest were painters and scaffolding and the odd tree).

So that was INCREDIBLY cool.&nbsp; Fortunately they&#8217;re sensible about safety over there, cautious without being prohibitively so&#8230; only "requirement" which they had was my use of a hardhat in a designated area being renovated (Old Teachers&#8217; College).&nbsp; All roof-climbing was basically "don&#8217;t do anything stupid like go too near the edge", which was incredibly useful, especially considering I was trying to take photographs&#8230; barriers and rails, etc. would have been seriously irritating!

In other exciting news, I scored a Pentium 3-866 today, as well as (what I think is) a TNT-2 and a Socket 370 mobo to match the Pentium 3 (onboard sound, too).&nbsp; Oh yeah, and also picked up a 10/100 network card AND an incredibly useful front-USB 5 1/4" bay plate.&nbsp; Hooray for a wasteful society, reap the benefits!&nbsp; Yeah!!!&nbsp; Hehehe.&nbsp; In between setting up Gallery and entering 38 descriptions, as well as miscellanous other things, I haven&#8217;t yet had time to test the hardware.&nbsp; It will happen!&nbsp; I&#8217;ll make it happen!

I promise as soon as I have that running, updates shall be posted&#8230;
