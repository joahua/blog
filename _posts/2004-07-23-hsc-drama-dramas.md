Hmm.&nbsp; Well, that production sucked.&nbsp; That is to say, the performance was good, and the technical side of things was not so good.

Which only serves to further disappoint, it&#8217;d seem &#8211; there *are* some productions where there is little or no dependance on technical resources&#8230; but this wasn&#8217;t one of them.&nbsp; Then there are productions that suck so much because of the performance that technical can&#8217;t suck more.&nbsp; But this wasn&#8217;t one of them, either.

I could blame it on a whole heap of things.&nbsp; Lack of monitor, or even open windows the day prior (we couldn&#8217;t hear, so we didn&#8217;t know cues for performances).&nbsp; In the end, we didn&#8217;t get monitor even on the night, which was just frogging marvellous for trying to cue things (we were running the show from CD, because there wasn&#8217;t time to rip tracks to my laptop &#8211; I got there at about 4:15, having left Sydney Uni at 4:00, and we were in rehearsals from then until the show started).&nbsp; Dinner?&nbsp; Pfft!&nbsp; Fast food isn&#8217;t fast enough!

Yeah.&nbsp; There&#8217;s my justification for it.&nbsp; The real story is that our communications sucked, and logistically, it was impossible to have the right people for the right show.&nbsp; That, and authoratiarian control over everything right down to the bloody locks on the windows (which, might I add for future reference, WILL be broken if the show is about to start and they&#8217;re still shut, regardless to the cost or inconvenience incurred to the Dictators of SACS) certainly didn&#8217;t help matters.

Yeah, I&#8217;m angry, bitter and twisted.&nbsp; What&#8217;re you going to do?&nbsp; I&#8217;m not doing the show tonight, and I&#8217;m kind of glad.&nbsp; Maybe it&#8217;ll suck less.&nbsp; Maybe communication will happen.&nbsp; Maybe venue difficulties won&#8217;t be so prohibitive.

That said, there&#8217;ll still be no monitor audio, and the one guy with access to all required resources (and the one guy on payroll to do this stuff) has decided that it&#8217;s not convenient for him to be there.&nbsp; Good luck, Ben.

To year 12: Sorry, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re not getting marked on Technical.
