Finished up there today, and decided I&#8217;d go for another trip with Peter&#8217;s beeeeeeeaaaaaaautiful Sony DSC-P10 again.&nbsp; This time around they&#8217;re not as good, because I played with the zoom a bit too much, and lack sufficient motor control to stop myself from shaking(no tripod + zoom = blur, hehe)!

I went for a wander (okay, a brisk wander&#8230; more of a gallop ;) ) through Victoria Park at lunchtime today, snapping shots of gardens, and other things.&nbsp; The reason?&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; I wanted to play with the camera, for one.&nbsp; And some of the photos are for a friend.&nbsp; They&#8217;re something of a personification, in response to a self-portrait&#8230;

Still, despite my shakiness and inability to control that beautiful camera, there are some decent shots in this lot (accessible at my Gallery page whenever my computer is on &#8211; direct link to album [http://nicktangents.is-a-geek.com/gallery/view\_album.php?set\_albumName=vicpark23july04][1]), or so I&#8217;d hope&#8230;

I&#8217;ve made the [third image][2] in the gallery my wallpaper, that&#8217;s probably my favorite of the lot&#8230; let me know what you think of them, if you think anything of them at all.
