I&#8217;d been having a few good months, so I guess it was finally time to destroy a bit of gear.&nbsp; Nothing spectacular, unfortunately. It just went from being marginally fnarked to unbootable &#8211; originally, I was getting BIOS checksum errors (but it&#8217;d still reluctantly boot from a floppy, although IDE/ATAPI wasn&#8217;t anything more than a pipe-dream).

Downloaded FreeDOS, banged on AWDFLASH.EXE and (what it turns out WASN&#8217;T) the firmware, plugged it in, got errors.&nbsp; Overrode errors, screen goes black.

Josh says some bad words.

Josh (still in third person) looks at other screen, re-reads bad Taiwanese translation carefully.&nbsp; It turns out that the "latest" firmware under 693A wasn&#8217;t actually for that motherboard.&nbsp; God only knows what it WAS for&#8230;&nbsp; but me, I have no idea.&nbsp; So, kiddies.&nbsp; The moral of this story is that the /nbl switch for AWDFLASH is evil, and should never be used unless you&#8217;re 100% certain that it&#8217;s the right firmware, are God, or read Taiwanese.

Grr.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll bang the BIOS chip in another computer in a while and flash it with the correct image this time around.
