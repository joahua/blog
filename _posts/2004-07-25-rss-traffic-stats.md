At some time between 4am yesterday and 4am this morning, my news syndication feed became the most requested file on this website, surpassing even the image-generation file (you know the fancy titles for news that appears on the front page, and above all news articles?), which is loaded several times per single impression on the front page.

So the old RSS is getting a bit of a workout, evidently.

Since its introduction last Saturday, the RSS feed has attracted 2491 hits, at an average of 3.28KB/page load.&nbsp; Nearly 8MB of raw XML served in one week.&nbsp; Pretty funky stuff, all things considered (heh, "all things" in this instance being the readership of ~3 people).

That said, incidental traffic seems to be up this month (I know we&#8217;re not there yet, I&#8217;m getting in early), with unique impressions on track to remain level with last month, but a clear rise in overall visits is evident.&nbsp; Repeat traffic is good, providing it&#8217;s not just F5-leaning.

There&#8217;s a bit of insight into what RSS is doing around here for you&#8230;
