Voice recognition.&nbsp; All the way.&nbsp; Sure, it could get expensive, but presumably not more so than WAP would be (well, okay; it would be, but if any value at all is placed on time, then calling a number and dictating ownz trying to type into a mobile keypad anyday!).

It&#8217;d mean I could walk between buildings and blog as I go, not in a crappy wi-fi enabled kind of way (although, admittedly, if SACS coverage extended to the vicinity surrounding the school, I&#8217;d probably have bought a wireless card by now and had a hack at making it work), but in a fluent, hands-free, talk-into-phone-and-content-appears-online kind of way.

How cool would that be?!&nbsp; Never again would there be a complaint of "you haven&#8217;t updated your blog since last time I checked a few hours ago!", because not an hour would pass without a phonecall and a voice-enabled update of the website!!

Well, okay.&nbsp; An hour would pass.&nbsp; In fact, many hours would pass.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s a cool idea, don&#8217;t you think?&nbsp; Still, several phone calls a day (let&#8217;s throw three in the air as a ballpark figure, not counting at-home updates) would add up.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s do the maths, shall we?&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So, let&#8217;s say an Orange phone serverside, so I get free five minute phone calls from my baby Samsung.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s make it prepaid &#8211; not as though we&#8217;re making calls from it.

A chargeable call must be made within a 12 month period, or the service will get narfed.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; That&#8217;s cool, I can setup an SMS gateway online and use that occasionally.&nbsp; Bonus.&nbsp; Cost?&nbsp; Assuming I keep the calls under 5mins, nothing to connect &#8211; there&#8217;s a limit on the amount of free Orange-to-Orange time I can have a month, but it&#8217;s pretty ridiculously high, so I&#8217;d not worry about that too much &#8211; and the cost for the prepaid?&nbsp; Well, between $33 and $90, depending on the expiry length required.&nbsp; So if I go for $90, that gives me a year to use the credit.

At what rate?&nbsp; $0.18/message sent, and of course, recieving calls is free.

So let&#8217;s say about $50 a year, plus initial handset cost.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s face it, I&#8217;m not really one for bothering to login to a web interface to send messages most of the time &#8211; I&#8217;d use it, but not incredibly often.

All this is of course ignoring the technical feasibility of using telephony as a voice-recognition medium &#8211; not only do current systems struggle with microphones already, this is also without the other conditions imposed on mobile lines!&nbsp; The software side of things (i.e. interfacing with web panel/directly with MySQL) also presents a little bit of a challenge, although not prohibitive &#8211; it&#8217;d be a bit of fun, to say the least.

This&#8217;d make me blog more, though.&nbsp; A lot more.&nbsp; That said, I blog more when procrastinating, or when holidays are on &#8211; the simple solution?&nbsp; Give me more holidays (or assessments:|)!!!

Overcomplication of a simple problem rocks.
