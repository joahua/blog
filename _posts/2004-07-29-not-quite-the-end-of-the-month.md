&#8230;but close enough for me to engage in a favorite past-time!&nbsp; Yay for log speculation!&nbsp; The game where Josh picks random facts and figures from log files and tries to make himself feel important because of it!!

Muwahahaha.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; So, whilst Google and certain MSN search engines struggle to find my website when I type "Joshua Street" into them (I have an unfortunate last name, it&#8217;d seem), it would appear that content around these parts \*IS\* attracting attention&#8230; even if that attention is ill-founded and soon ignores this website and heads off elsewhere.

At the top of the search list are various references to phpSysInfo CVS versions, and how to download it, etc.&nbsp; After that, it&#8217;s more phpSysInfo stuff (popular one, that), then references to using SuSE with my onboard sound card (the Realtek thing &#8211; ALC650 chipset) which I don&#8217;t think was the main focus of that article (the other card was &#8211; the Realtek onboard stuff was an aside &#8211; actually, it was quite irritating), but hey!

Things just go downhill from there, with some people apparently finding this website by searching for mug warmers (regarding comments made previously about certain USB gimmicks).

That said, though, I must be doing \*something\* right, as I got a hit or three from CSIRO this month!&nbsp; Hey, that&#8217;s cool.&nbsp; I hope they&#8217;re not taking anything said here as authoritive, though, in the interest of international science ;)

Hmm.&nbsp; What else?&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been overrun by Swedes!!&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; Comments made on [Lizette &][1]&#8216;s website sent a few hits flying this way, as well as some comments by various band members &#8211; I&#8217;m still impressed by that level of involvement on their part!!&nbsp; Yes, Swedes and Canadians (okay, .com and .net namespace ranked higher, but that&#8217;s so generic I can hardly call it US hits) were the highest international visitors this month, which is pretty funky stuff.

The world domination is well underway, but I&#8217;ve been kindly informed that between eight and sixteen MB of traffic needs to hit this website this month in order to push traffic over the amazing psychological barrier, the "1GB mark!!".&nbsp; How that&#8217;ll happen, I have no idea!&nbsp; Maybe MSN will let their crazy search bots out of the cage again, that&#8217;d do it nicely.&nbsp; So far this month, they&#8217;ve thrown over 750 hits this direction&#8230; aaaaaaaaaaannnnddd they then seem to be sending that information to /dev/null, or whatever the crappy Windows equivalent is ;)&nbsp; Why do I make this horrible accusation?&nbsp; Well, last time I checked (only briefly, to be fair), my website wasn&#8217;t showing up at ALL on MSN search, but was coming up on Google (less than 20 hits this month) just fine.

World domination, one step at a time.&nbsp; World dominators don&#8217;t need MSN, anyway.
