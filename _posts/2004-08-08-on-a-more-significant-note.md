The previous post was trivial compared to this.&nbsp; This is amazing, astounding news.

THEY CHANGED THE DESIGN OF MY [FAVORITE PEN][1]!!!

It wasn&#8217;t a MAJOR design change, but this surpasses all other things, simply because it&#8217;s my favorite pen!

What did they do?&nbsp; Just removed some BIC branding from the side of the barrel, nothing major.&nbsp; But it FEELS different to hold!&nbsp; It&#8217;s WEIRD!

Ah well.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll get used to it in a few weeks/days/hours.

The thing is, I consistently replace my pens with the same &#8211; yes, that&#8217;s right &#8211; stationary brand loyalty!&nbsp; Except it&#8217;s more defined than that&#8230; this is PRODUCT loyalty!

If I didn&#8217;t, then I would wind up feeling like [this][2], which would really suck a lot.&nbsp; The line begins to fade?&nbsp; Buy a new pen, exactly the same!&nbsp; Don&#8217;t notice the difference, except the line becomes thicker, richer, better &#8211; I love my pen.
