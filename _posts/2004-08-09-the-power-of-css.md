I stumbled across this today, speaking of the transition between tables-based and non-standards centric design to CSS, standards compliant development.

I&#8217;m looking forward to the next person asking me why I care about standards at all getting stabbed in the face with this quote:

> As for bandwidth, roughly speaking [Multimap.com][1] serves 4 million pages a day. On average, the HTML of the old site weighed in at 65kb per page. The new site pages are half that at 35Kb. That&#8217;s a saving of 40,000 Gb of bandwidth per year! I&#8217;ll leave you to translate that into money, but I can tell you the move to Web standards paid for itself within a month.

&#8220;The move to Web standards paid for itself within a month.&#8221;

How incredible is that?&nbsp; Admittedly, a website attracting this volume of traffic isn&#8217;t exactly typical of most, but that isn&#8217;t the point.

This demonstrates REAL and TANGIBLE benefits to standards compliance, besides the other, self-evident benefits of the same.&nbsp; What&#8217;s not to like about making the web more accessible, display better on all platforms, and ultimately allow a wider audience access to your resource?

I could rant about this for longer, of course.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t, though.&nbsp; Check out <http://webstandardsgroup.org/> for the source of that quotation&#8230; they&#8217;ve also got a whole heap of other interesting stuff on there.
