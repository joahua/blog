Yeah!&nbsp; Brrraaaaaaand new BenQ 19" LCD just arrived, and it&#8217;s kickin&#8217;.

<http://www.benq.com.au/HomeShowProduct.asp?prodID=239>

Model number is FP992, and it&#8217;s pretty funky.&nbsp; Aside from being just plain HUUUUUUUGE, it also displays Stuff&trade;, which is always desirable in a monitor.&nbsp; Further, it&#8217;s the heaviest damn LCD screen I&#8217;ve ever had to deal with.&nbsp; And it does portrait mode, which is always interesting.&nbsp; Haven&#8217;t had a chance to play with that properly, yet.&nbsp; On the to-do list.

Oh, yeah, and it works sexily with our DVD player (which has VGA output), after a spot of hacking (yeah, go figure &#8211; less than 3 hours out of the box, and already it&#8217;s being hacked with!).

This evening has been throughly unproductive, I&#8217;m glad to say.&nbsp; Eye-candy for the masses!
