\*sticks fingers in ears\* I CAN&#8217;T HEAR THE ASSESSMENTS LOOMING!&nbsp; THEY&#8217;RE NOT THERE!!!

Sigh.&nbsp; Had physics today, that was good for a laugh.&nbsp; Or a cry at its pathetic nature.&nbsp; Or something.&nbsp; That said, I can just see myself really bombing out SOMEHOW when the marks come back.&nbsp; Pfft.

Oh, yeah, and they just went and moved our yearlies back two weeks.&nbsp; Three weeks to go, or thereabouts.&nbsp; Maybe four?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t remember the date, but it&#8217;s too close.

Pfft, screw the yearly drama production.  
The school can hire more people like Will to do stuff for them.&nbsp; Throughly uninterested.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so over it, really.&nbsp; Sure, the fact that our exams are a week after or something probably doesn&#8217;t INCREASE my interest, but that&#8217;s not the only factor influencing the decision, either.

I have an extension assessment/seminar presentation to give on Monday.&nbsp; I consider myself to be screwed for it, and am preparing to fail.&nbsp; No, that wasn&#8217;t a defeatist attitude speaking&#8230; it was me, typing.&nbsp; This one seems to have sort of crept up on me without notice&#8230; although I know that&#8217;s not true.&nbsp; AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

Yes, anyway.&nbsp; At least there is a day of Nothingness next week.&nbsp; I really AM looking forward to the atheletics carnival, as scary as that may seem.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a day sans work or assessments or immediate stress.&nbsp; Can&#8217;t wait.

I need sleep.&nbsp; Today was so exhausting.&nbsp; Goodnight, all.
