Wow.&nbsp; This computer is now magically capable of actually DOWNLOADING Stuff&trade; without my having to first download it onto my desktop then push content onto it using Samba!

I&#8217;m awed!&nbsp; Heh, that said, because it was a nasty-install-over-the-top job, there&#8217;s probably still virii and spyware lurking in the depths, just waiting for me to do the wrong thing and accidentally activate it, but hey.&nbsp; I&#8217;m doing the obligatory Windows Update thang, and then it&#8217;s straight off to AVG to download the latest definitions and other such things.

Yay!&nbsp; Heh, I haven&#8217;t been so excited about a Windows install for quite a while now&#8230;&nbsp; Oh well, there&#8217;s still time for it to shatter my expectations, I suppose ;)
