I was doing the daily blog-run, and came across a website (not one of my regulars, I just stumbled accross it) which used something called "Audblog".

It&#8217;s not quite voice recognition, but it&#8217;s pretty damn close to what I wanted/want.&nbsp; You call, it records and posts.&nbsp; No speech2text conversion in there, but hey&#8230; that&#8217;s alright, it&#8217;s close enough.

Pretty damn cool.&nbsp; <http://www.audblog.com/> for more info.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a pay-service, and US-based, so calls from landlines would be expensiveish (haha, oh, the irony of it all&#8230; I get cheaper calls to telephones in the US than I do to mobiles in Australia&#8230; hehehe).
