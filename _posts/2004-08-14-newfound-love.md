Hmm.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve decided that P2P networks can be a most useful device indeed.&nbsp; Despite their potential for abuse.

I lost the Gateway Windows Me CD (I have absolutely NO idea how that was managed, seeing that EVERY OTHER system disc is still in my folder for such things, but hey!) for the Celery laptop, and have just finished downloading a nice new full ISO of Windows Me (heh, I laughed when the ISO preparer was marked as Microsoft themselves&#8230; yay for direct ripping!).&nbsp; I was half expecting it not to work or something, but hey, it does.&nbsp; Very cool.

Yes, this evidently makes me an evil pirate, and the peer to peer networks should be shut down, and users should never lose discs.&nbsp; Well, that would be okay, if copyright law in this esteemed country made provision for "Fair Use".&nbsp; No matter what I do, I&#8217;d be breaking the law.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t keep a copy locally, and I can&#8217;t download a copy remotely&#8230; what&#8217;s a geek to do?&nbsp; Heh, hardly a geek, even &#8211; this thing is running Millenium.&nbsp; Ah well.&nbsp; It works okay, despite all the bad press.&nbsp; It was built by an OEM, and came with an OEM dist. of Millenium (which, of course, I have now lost and replaced with a stock image of, but hey), so it has to run acceptably.

Hmmmm.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Now I can finally dub (well, not strictly dub, but meh:P) some of the accumulating Platform 7 recordings (on tape) to file&#8230; well, I could before, if I could be bothered to move my desktop into the lounge room.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s just too far away, and would mean too much time spent away from email ;)

"Copying files needed for Windows Setup&#8230;"&nbsp; Hurry up and copy already!!!&nbsp; Sigh.

In other interesting news, I&#8217;ve discovered why Google isn&#8217;t indexing this website properly.&nbsp; Apparently my URL&#8217;s are too complex&#8230; SE&#8217;s can deal with query strings to an extent, but apparently any more than two and a bit and they start to struggle/or at least ignore bits.

The solution would basically mean either using URI&#8217;s of the form http://baseaddress/?$style.$page.$extravariable1.$extravariable2 etc., or using mod_rewrite to make even more friendly URL&#8217;s.

I&#8217;m not sure exactly what would be the most scalable way to do this, and haven&#8217;t got time immediately available to determine this&#8230; I may look at it next weekend, or later next week depending on other workload and the progress of existing web projects.

And that concludes my procrastination for this half hour&#8230;&nbsp; back to the Extension seminar preparation and things like that!
