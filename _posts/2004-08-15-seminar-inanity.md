It&#8217;s not completely devoid of substance, but it *is* far less than I had planned for.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been on a nervousness induced high all day, and I think I&#8217;m starting to crash.&nbsp; Probably a good thing, if the myths about sleep are to be believed.

So I think I&#8217;m going to be ditching a text.&nbsp; Dammit.&nbsp; This is so uncool.&nbsp; AHHHHHHHHH.&nbsp; Pfft.&nbsp; No, I&#8217;ll go overtime.&nbsp; Screw them.&nbsp; The Matrix stays, dammit.

LALALALALA I CAN&#8217;T HEAR THAT OVERTIME BUZZER

If it&#8217;s engaging enough, maybe they&#8217;ll forget.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s assuming a certain standard of work, of course.&nbsp; Yep, I&#8217;m screwed.&nbsp; BLAH!

For those who hadn&#8217;t guessed/been listening to my inane rantings, I&#8217;ve got an English seminar presentation to give tomorrow.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so thankful we have 10 minutes, because that&#8217;s way more than what they&#8217;d usually give us, and from a logistical point of view, that makes sense&#8230; however it doesn&#8217;t stop me from wanting more.

Haha.&nbsp; And if they do make me want to stop?&nbsp; The irony will be, my presentation shall end not with a bang, but a whimper ;)&nbsp; You&#8217;d have to be there&#8230;
