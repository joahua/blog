Well, I&#8217;m fairly happy at the minute.&nbsp; Physics fell in a screaming heap from the 6th floor of SAH, landing in a somewhat diminished state on the adjacent Kent Street.

Reports that this caused traffic delays of up to fifteen minutes are unconfirmed, although it has been ascertained that traffic in certain parts of the city is moving at no more than two meters per minute, or so our correspondant, Joshua Street, writes from Circular Quay.

&#8212;

That aside, I now have a magnificent fourteen Studyhall periods per cycle, and no Physics to boot!&nbsp; Wooooooo!!!&nbsp; Chances are, had you met me in person this afternoon, this would have already been apparent to you from the ludicrous grin pasted on my face, but hey.&nbsp; Sincere apologies to [anyone][1] I distracted, who was previously trying to get work done in studyhall Period 4.

So, anyway, here it is:  
![My new timetable - no longer current, so don't worry about ALT text][2]  
Highlighted entries denote new studyhall periods.

I like!
