I had an interesting product sample land on my desk today (in a fairly literal sense: I honestly have absolutely no idea from whence it came!), which can only be described as gimmicky in a moderately useless way.

It&#8217;s a mouse.&nbsp; Which is okay, in and of itself.&nbsp; It&#8217;s quite a nice mouse, as far as these things go: it feels slightly lighter than my existing A4 USB thing, it moves more smoothly (hey, it&#8217;s a newer mouse, it&#8217;s to be expected)&#8230; nothing spectacular, but still, very usable.

For your admiration:

"Ooooh."

What is that red thing, I hear you enquire?

That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m wondering, actually.&nbsp; The packaging on this mysterious object advertises it as follows:  
**Labtec**  
Wheel Mouse  
&nbsp; &nbsp; with Light

The word "Light" is in red.

Note that in this instance, "Light" does not mean "Optical Mouse".

Observe:

You&#8217;ll note the presence of a futile red LED, as well as a black mouse ball.&nbsp; Wonderful!

The mouse itself is decent (hey, it was free, no complaints from yours truly), but really: this is almost as bad as iiNet&#8217;s [false value-adding schemes][3]!&nbsp; Ah well.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not quite false advertising, but the implication is certainly there.

I&#8217;ve seen 5-unit pricing of optical mouses at $16 in the last six months, so surely it can&#8217;t be that much more expensive to ACTUALLY manufacture the real product!&nbsp; I&#8217;d imagine these would go for about $11 retail/unit, and down to $7 or $8 for OEM dealers.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a measly $8!&nbsp; I don&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s worth risking the wrath of upset consumers who purchase your product in error, but maybe that&#8217;s just me&#8230;
