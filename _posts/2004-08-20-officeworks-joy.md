One of my more favoured pasttimes is the purchasing of stationary; as nerdy as this may seem, it&#8217;s something I actually enjoy quite a lot.&nbsp; Following discussions (where discussions is synonymous with email sessions, but hey, I am a geek as well as a nerd, it would seem) had regarding&#8230; well, many things&#8230; but the use of paper as an outlet came up.

I&#8217;d been meaning to get my hands on a nice notebook or two for some time now, and it was with some glee that I moved upon Officeworks in Clarence St. this afternoon to make this purchase.&nbsp; As far as Officeworks stores go, that one kind of sucks&#8230; the range just isn&#8217;t there.&nbsp; That said, I *did* find what I was looking for.

See, what I want to know is why the accountant people get such cool notebooks whilst the rest of us suffer ring-bound crap!&nbsp; Seriously!&nbsp; Accountant people AREN&#8217;T that cool!&nbsp; We (Ben was along for the ride, or something) discovered a range of notebooks akin to what I was looking for (a properly bound pad, *without* any dodgy ring crappiness), IN THE ACCOUNTING AISLE!&nbsp; Well&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t exactly labelled as such&#8230; but it was HIDDEN in amidst all the ledger books and other such boredom inducing stuff.&nbsp; I think the accountants want to keep these pads to themselves.

\*insert conspiracy theory here\*

Yes, anyway.&nbsp; I ended up getting two A5 pads, weighing in at 168 pages each.&nbsp; So that was cool.

What happened next?&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; This bit is kind of weird.&nbsp; Jokingly or not, I haven&#8217;t asked, but Ben (in the course of conversation, not just randomly) raised his hand to his mouth, saying "Oooh, a diary!" in mock-shocked tones.&nbsp; I shrugged it off, without giving a direct answer, I think&#8230; but yes, that is what one of the two pads is for, if the world must know (which of course it DOESN&#8217;T, but I don&#8217;t mind sharing that much).

See, what I&#8217;m struck by is how this can be construed as any different to the maintenance of a &#8216;blog site.&nbsp; This IS essentially a self-censored, abridged, restricted online diary.&nbsp; The three conditions there exist simply because *I am aware that the world has full access to all content posted on this resource*.&nbsp; More on that in a second &#8212; My point for now is that I&#8217;m yet to have anyone comment on this with shocked expressions and mocking tones (I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s what Ben did, because I don&#8217;t know for certain and didn&#8217;t think to find out at the time, but there IS a stigma attached, so it would seem, reflected in this mock/or not mock opinion conveyed), despite some saying they don&#8217;t understand WHY people would &#8216;blog (which I think is perfectly understandable, and I agree with some of their reservations).

So what makes this website any different from a paper diary?&nbsp; Structured content, for one.&nbsp; Paper is infinitively more intuitive.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s true.&nbsp; Graphics tablet?&nbsp; Pfft.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t FEEL the same. (heh, I was eyeing off some 110GSM paper this afternoon, but restrained myself).&nbsp; Structure has two aspects, though.&nbsp; This website isn&#8217;t searchable as yet (well, not via the interface most users here see &#8212; my local mirror has had experimentation done with varying degrees of success), but it could be with moderate effort.&nbsp; Everything is also sorted by date, and has permanent reference links.

Now, if I wanted searchable, dated content, I&#8217;d probably be using a system designed for such, i.e. NOT paper.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; And really, that demand can&#8217;t make what people do with paper that different to what hundreds of people worldwide do with weblogs.&nbsp; Personally, I try to keep my whinge sessions here to a minimum, both to avoid giving offence, and to avoid narcissistic trappings which such things can provide, especially if others begin to comment (ultimately fuelling the fire)&#8230; that said, I read many webloggers pages which aren&#8217;t like that, and are effectively a diary openly published to the world.

There is something about that I admire, I think, that they can be so open (or at least "open") about their life.&nbsp; But then there are other websites which leave a sense of "get over it" hanging in the air.&nbsp; Like one weblog I read, about a guy whose relationship with his girlfriend ended two and half years ago.&nbsp; There was a lot of content on there, so I didn&#8217;t read all of it.&nbsp; I skipped about a quarter of a year at a time, but the consistent theme was this one girl, and his ensuing depression.&nbsp; Okay, I&#8217;m not going to speculate as to whether he "should" or "shouldn&#8217;t" be depressed &#8212; that&#8217;s a matter for him personally.&nbsp; If using the web as a medium for expression assists him, then great.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think it was, though.&nbsp; After two and a half years, I think that other things need to be explored.

I know I&#8217;m guilty of using this publishing medium as a "sympathy net" at times, although it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ll deliberately set out to achieve when writing content.&nbsp; Disclaimer out of the way, I&#8217;d like to direct your attention to a [blog article][1] posted a few days ago.

"Is that what blogs are about?&nbsp; Selfish desires." &#8211; that provokes some thought for all personal (i.e. non-professional only) blog sites.&nbsp; Something I&#8217;m now aiming more to actively avoid, because I hadn&#8217;t thought about it too hard, and it&#8217;s a very valid point IMHO.

Apparently, though, the use of private expressionistic writing is something which is odd, unusual, taboo, undiscussed.&nbsp; Thoughts, anyone?&nbsp; What difference, if any, is there between private and public diary entry, online or otherwise?&nbsp; Is there a stigma attached to mediums or modes of writing?
