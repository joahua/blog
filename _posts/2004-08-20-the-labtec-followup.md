Certain comments made previously are today being retracted.

This thing is damn cool.&nbsp; It&#8217;s still perfectly useless, but at least it&#8217;s no-longer useless and mediocre!&nbsp; Now, it&#8217;s possible that other lit-up mouses do this (I wouldn&#8217;t know, having never slept/been in dark places with Optical mouses and turned-off computers), but I&#8217;m impressed at the sheer trippyness of this product.

IT KEEPS GLOWING EVEN WHEN THE COMPUTER IS TURNED OFF!&nbsp; How insanely cool is that?!?!&nbsp; I&#8217;m so glad I don&#8217;t sleep in line of sight with my work area, because this thing would enhance insomnia no end!

5:00 &#8211; entrancing red glow continues  
6:00 &#8211; The rising sun begins to distract Josh, as does the harsh sound of the alarm clock on his phone.&nbsp; Realising that hours have been spent gazing upon this warm glowy red object, he falls into a restless sleep for 45 minutes, before waking up more tired than he went to sleep, and continuing with the daily routine.

Phwoar.&nbsp; Respect for Labtec just increased back to normal levels again.&nbsp; The whole "with light" actually means that&#8230; it&#8217;s not a bid to make people think "optical", afterall!&nbsp; In fact, I&#8217;d say they&#8217;ve done the underpromise, overdeliver trick&#8230; there is NO mention of glowy artifacts when computers are turned off on the packaging!

Possibly because this depends on the motherboard&#8217;s handling of the PS/2 port power management, but let&#8217;s not get technical&#8230; bottom line is, I have a cool mouse, and it was free.
