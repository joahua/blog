Just got around to installing GRI&#8217;s Anti-Virus software on the crappy Pentium box (running &#8217;98, one of two remaining Windows computers in this household &#8212; and switches across on that one have been considered&#8230; more than a few times before).&nbsp; Twenty minutes later, it&#8217;s lost 14 separate viruses&#8230; hopefully this will mean that the stupid thing stops creating network storms whenever it is turned on and plugged in to everything else.

I really don&#8217;t see WHY viruses are created!&nbsp; My goodness!&nbsp; The creators don&#8217;t really stand to GAIN from it, and viruses aren&#8217;t (for the most part) actually THAT harmful &#8212; just bloody annoying and time consuming!&nbsp; Bleh.&nbsp; I have no idea exactly what any of those fourteen viruses did&#8230; there were some trojans in there, but it really had minimal impact, what with ipchains and NAT running on my Coyote box (that said, I don&#8217;t know how much longer I&#8217;ll stick with Coyote on that thing&#8230; starting to get itchy fingers, wanting to switch it over to Slack or Debian or something and run Samba and Apache, amongst other things, on it.)

Aside from that, I just finished the "product" I&#8217;m submitting for this next assessment task (business studies) &#8212; they&#8217;re only getting a paper manual, though, because source-code is more than I would ever trust that department with, regardless as to it&#8217;s actual value (in man hours or anything else: my IP (or clients IP, depending on how you look at it) is more valuable than any crappy assessment they can throw our way).

Hmm.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to go and work like crazy for about an hour, so I&#8217;ve got time to get down to church this evening.&nbsp; Assessments are bad.&nbsp; Or rather, the importance I place on them is bad.&nbsp; Last weekend was pretty terrible&#8230; I ended up leaving after our bible study and before church last week, because of my complete lack of time management with that Extension task!

Back to business&#8230;
