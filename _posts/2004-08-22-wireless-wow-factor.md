Oh. My. Goodness.&nbsp; That&#8217;s cheaper than my current plan, and better geared towards my bandwidth usage patterns!

And, at only $3 a GB if I go over, it doesn&#8217;t matter either way (well, not much).

Ahhh!!&nbsp; Dilema!!!&nbsp; iiNet are just on the brink of announcing more DSLAM rollouts, with semi-unlimited upload speeds&#8230; I guess I&#8217;ll wait for that list to be unveiled before trying to make any further decisions on this one.

What exists in Sydney in the way of consumer (i.e. not business) VoIP gateway services?&nbsp; And can you use fax over VoIP?&nbsp; I&#8217;m so ready to ditch the phone line and go over this entirely:&nbsp; currently, we&#8217;re paying $25 for line rental, and $60 for ADSL a month.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re paying in calls, but it&#8217;d be enough.

This would be $0 in line rental, $45 for internet access, and some amount of telephony costs &#8211; if nothing else, we&#8217;d save massively interstate/long distance and international.&nbsp; Even if voice usage consumed large-ish amounts of bandwidth, I can&#8217;t see it using more than a GB per month (so, add $3 to telephony costs) &#8212; that&#8217;s based on the fact that if I stream a 192kbps stream for 8 and a half hours, it only uses about 900MB &#8212; and it&#8217;s safe to presume that VoIP won&#8217;t be anywhere near that sort of quality!

Meh, can&#8217;t think about it now&#8230; still got this stupid assessment unfinished, must keep working.&nbsp; More to post, but that actually requires thought, not just techno-babble, so it will come in a while&#8230;

**EDIT: ** More has been posted, and backdated to when it actually SHOULD have appeared.&nbsp; See article [106, &#8220;A feast for sore eyes&#8221;][1] for more!
