Just stumbled across this website, <http://www.zimoblog.com/>.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not audio, or even text-to-speech, but it&#8217;s a cool extension of blogging technology.

No idea what costs are involved, if any, and it looks like you need to use their proprietry service (at a glance only, I didn&#8217;t look too closely).
