Wooo.&nbsp; Happy to report that it went a thousand times better than the trials, so that was most excellent.&nbsp; Nerves kicked in where they hadn&#8217;t been seen before (Sophie?! Nervous?! Apparently so&#8230;), but the performances were generally excellent (better than last year, so far as my memory serves) in all facets.

That&#8217;s been my last two and a half days at school, pretty much.&nbsp; It was excellent, actually.&nbsp; An event completely sans certain medling staff members!&nbsp; My goodness!&nbsp; Hehehe.&nbsp; We *still* don&#8217;t have monitor audio in the booth, so we settled for physically removing the windows from the frame.&nbsp; That middle one had some nasty glass shards flying from it as we tried to put it back in, but the other two were okay(-ish).&nbsp; No, not joking ;)

Hmm.&nbsp; What else did we do?&nbsp; Oh, yes.&nbsp; Who remembers the old clock that was on the wall in the auditorium?&nbsp; Yeah&#8230; it came down a while ago, and had been sitting in the booth in the way, doing a whole lot of not much.

So we went in for some interior re-decoration!&nbsp; There was this sturdy looking thumbtack, see.&nbsp; And the walls were notably poorly plastered.&nbsp; So it was time (haha) to make another hole to mount something of our own&#8230; observe:

![A clock, as described][1]

Do you think it looks nice on there?&nbsp; I think it looks nice on there.&nbsp; We left it up at the end of today, at any rate, so other users of that space will be able to appreciate the passing of time with style!

In other news, I have a modern assessment to complete, so I&#8217;d best be going to patch that up.&nbsp; Keep ticking&#8230;
