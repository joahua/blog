I just turned to my printed modern essay which I&#8217;m editing from, and reached for the mouse to stop it from going onto a screensaver.

This is either a reflection on my procrastination, or the pervasive nature of technology upon users day to day lives.&nbsp; Not the first time this has happened, of course, but my blog panel just happened to be sitting in the next window, so I flicked to it.

I need to kill my screensaver.
