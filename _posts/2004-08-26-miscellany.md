I can&#8217;t stop sneezing.

mod_rewrite and other things are being tested out for this website as I write this.

My left hand was attacked with a pair of scissors by a munted one this afternoon.&nbsp; It bled for a while, then stopped.

My design hand is getting itchy fingers whenever I see this website.&nbsp; Even if change doesn&#8217;t come soon, the thought is there.

I need to restructure the way content is handled around here, urgently.&nbsp; This erratic, five-a-day posting isn&#8217;t good for things.&nbsp; Stay tuned for more.
