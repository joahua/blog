Okay, so I finally got sick of using my own thing. Why? Pfft. It was unsupported, not-so-interoperable, and hacks and fun stuff didn&#8217;t work out-of-the-.tar.gz-archive for it. Well, okay. I&#8217;m lazy, that&#8217;s why. And WordPress is *infinitely* more fun to use, as well as being quicker, cooler, and nicer.

What&#8217;s not to like?

There are many things which are exactly the same about it, only done more intuitively, but there are also some completely new features. Like trackback/pingbacks. And post statuses (Draft or Private, anyone? I can work on a post, mark it as draft, and continue later. Or, if I don&#8217;t want the world to see a post, then I can mark it as private. Or just set a password on the post. Whatever!)

My only qualm is getting existing content to play nice with WordPress. At the minute, I don&#8217;t know if I will/can be bothered, but we shall see.
