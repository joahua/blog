I just remembered that I haven&#8217;t yet posted my submitted subject selections for next year, so here it is:

Advanced English &#8211; 2 units  
Extension 2 English &#8211; 2 units  
Modern History &#8211; 2 units  
Mathematics &#8211; 2 units  
Business Studies &#8211; 2 units  
Information Technology Framework &#8211; 2 units  
&#8212;&#8212;-  
Information Technology Specialisation Studies &#8211; 2 units (Board-accredited, not relevant to UAI)

Total of 12+2 units.

I&#8217;m excited about the lack of physics on that list, and the addition of a unit of English.&nbsp; I&#8217;m also excited about being able to lose a subject sometime next year &#8212; although it will be hard to decide which to lose, as Maths is&#8230; discouraging, but more enjoyable than Business Studies, which is dead boring, frustrating, but doable.&nbsp; Meh!&nbsp; That&#8217;s still a bit down the track, I guess.

In other news, which actually [happened a few days ago][1], but has only just come to my attention (whilst drinking Milo, no less &#8212; it really is a brain food/drink! &#8212; no, I&#8217;m not getting paid for product placement, I choose to!), I&#8217;ve decided that SACS really *is* scheduling drama events to co-incide with tests and assessments, specifically of the Mathematics variety.

Wednesday, HSC drama AND a maths test (which I missed, and was re-scheduled to Thursday anyway; not that it mattered, since I hadn&#8217;t looked at a maths book for about five days prior to that, and really did need to study).&nbsp; Earlier in the year?&nbsp; I think it was SACS Idol (which was in blog version 1.5, I think, which has since disappeared into the void &#8211; so no hyperlinking here), which we were halfway through bump-in for (Wednesday morning?) and I had a maths test.&nbsp; It may have even been the same day in the two-week cycle.&nbsp; Wouldn&#8217;t suprise me!

They&#8217;re out to get us.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t doubt it.

Man, I really want to wear a tinfoil hat into school some day.&nbsp; It&#8217;s on the list of crazy things to do.
