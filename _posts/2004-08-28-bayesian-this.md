I just cracked 6000 spam messages.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t wait until I start running my own mail server locally; I really really really want to see how much using all that sample material will stop dead!

Perhaps when iiNet bring their iiSLAM&#8217;s to Kensington, NSW&#8230; and if they keep the "testing" unlocked backchannel enabled!&nbsp; Haha, symmetric "A"DSL &#8211; Got to love it.

In other news, I&#8217;ve decided that I probably won&#8217;t be bothering with mod_rewrite on this iteration of the website, because I think it&#8217;s going to get dumped sometime in the near future anyway&#8230; that said, Google actually seems to be indexing down to my permalinks without any difficulties anyway!

I&#8217;m currently failing to see the benefit of using my own news/blog script over something more advanced, and would prefer to invest time in other projects (specifically, to enhance and extend the content management system to better support CSS, XHTML, semantics and improve authentication and user management, amongst many other things) rather than re-doing what&#8217;s been done before, and better, without seeing any real tangible benefit for it.&nbsp; And yes, I do know there are better, more advanced, more usable (open-source) CMS offerings out there.&nbsp; Integration of features offered by those products is something that is being explored, but until that is feasible, development of this one will continue&#8230;

Despite whatever nasty things people might have to say about [WordPress][1], the more I see, the more I like, so nyah.

At the minute, design and standards are something I&#8217;m far more passionate about, anyway.
