Wow. That&#8217;s&#8230; possibly the first time I&#8217;ve seen it do that! I went to open a file, wp-comments-reply.php, and it just froze. Kill process, rinse, repeat. Crashes again. Re-open, open another file. No problems. Open wp-comments-reply.php.

Crashes, again.

Doh! At least the file I was actually trying to edit opened okay&#8230; you can now post ordered and un-ordered lists in comments if you feel so inclined :P &#8230; I know I sometimes do!

*Later&#8230;*  
I just re-read the title of this post and burst out laughing. Just for the record, Quanta is an editing application, and **not** an Australian airline.
