I&#8217;ve had a cold for the last few days, which is impeding life and normal activity in general. A group of people from church were having a &#8220;cook-off&#8221; over two weeks, with the girls cooking for the guys last Friday, and the guys doing the same the following week&#8230; Hehe, someone will have to fill me in as to what standard of cooking is expected of us next week (assuming I don&#8217;t die/stop breathing/something between now and then)!

Marcello informs me that he was really impressed with the amount of effort they put in, which can only leave me a bit worried. :P We&#8217;ll come up with something killer&#8230; there&#8217;s still a whole five days between now and next Friday!

I&#8217;m missing church this evening, too, which is never great&#8230; less so seeing it&#8217;s Al Radloff&#8217;s third last week at ESM, before heading North-ish to the Gold Coast. I&#8217;m told that this place is even further North than Tori&#8217;s house, but this rumour remains unconfirmed. ;)
