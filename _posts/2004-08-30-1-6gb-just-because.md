According to my [system information][1] page on my local machine, I&#8217;ve downloaded 1.62 GBvia my local ethernet interface in the last 11 hours and 21 minutes (not downloading flat out, that just happened to be my system uptime when I last refreshed the page).

What was I doing? No LAN traffic, that much I know. There has been one other machine on for much of today which has created noise before, but post- viral and spyware purges, this &#8217;98 box has been squeaky clean (except for the one virus which powers it, of course).

Nah, I was downloading a couple of ISO&#8217;s from PlanetMirror, namely Mandrake 10 discs 1 and 2 &#8212; I don&#8217;t even know if I&#8217;m going to burn the images to CD, much less actually USE them on anything, but hey&#8230; that&#8217;s not what this is all about.<!--more-->

Some will recall a post I made previously (on *the olde blog*) regarding iiNet&#8217;s wonderfully bloated new quota limits for their ADSL plans&#8230; yeah&#8230; I&#8217;m still going on about that, sorry to appear pedantic&#8230; I am.

Anyway. Those two ISO images put a nice chunk in my monthly allowance, because it was starting to slip behind. You know that when the download meter starts telling you you can download 650, 700MB in a day, something has to happen&#8230; I&#8217;m just keeping up with my iiSP&#8217;s lofty expectations of their users!

&#8220;What would anyone download 12GB a month of?!&#8221; &#8212; the standing joke goes, &#8220;That&#8217;s a lot of Linux ISO&#8217;s&#8221;&#8230; it sure is.
