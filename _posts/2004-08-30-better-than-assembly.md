In no particular order, five reasons why [here][1] is better than an assembly at <acronym title="St. Andrews Cathedral School">SACS</acronym>&#8230;<!--more-->

*   I have chocolate here. In assembly, they object to the consumption of foodstuffs generally.
*   I have music. Playing over moderately nice Pioneer &#8216;phones, instead of the crappy Bose setup in the Cathedral.[(1)][2]
*   Whilst on the subject of music, especially music with headphones (which, incidentally, also aren&#8217;t permitted in assembly), I can sing/dance/beatbox along to whatever I want without attracting strange looks here. Help the poor souls I end up in the same workplace as&#8230;
*   I can blog from here, and I couldn&#8217;t there. Maybe that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll never see a &#8220;10 reasons why assembly is better than *x*&#8221; post here?
*   My heater is warm. Cavernous sandstone places are not.

5, my desk. 0, a typical SACS assembly. Not that I&#8217;m biased or anything.

<a name="footnote1">1.</a> Note: I very much doubt the equipment in use is crappy. The setup, however, is decidedly poor. Don&#8217;t believe me? Go into that space whenever there is next a performance which uses the A/V fitout in there, and sit in the center, or in the western gallery.
