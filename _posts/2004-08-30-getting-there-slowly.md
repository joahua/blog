Tinkering has been happening around the place&#8230; the commenting submit page is still broken.

I don&#8217;t *think* it&#8217;s any different from the stock 1.2 WordPress distribution, but&#8230; yeah, uncertain. Source can be viewed [here][1].

Well, I lie&#8230; the headers are still slightly different from stock because I thought that may be the problem. It wasn&#8217;t, but the headers were left anyway, seeing they work just as well and I couldn&#8217;t be bothered changing it back.

In other news, I&#8217;m still sick, hence time spent here&#8230;
