&#8230;has nothing to do with me running out of stamps.&nbsp; Or things to say, for that matter.&nbsp; Actually, I&#8217;ve been posting, just not here&#8230; the idea being that when I do switch accross, there will be content there from the first, and not just some "hey, it&#8217;s a page, look at the pretty page" post.&nbsp; Has it been successful?&nbsp; Arguably.

Can you see it yet?&nbsp; Not quite.

A handful of people have said various things about the design&#8230; personally, I&#8217;m going with the school of thought which says this new one is better.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t like it?&nbsp; Your problem.:p&nbsp; You can sit here, on this iteration of the website, forever browsing the same posts, getting as sick of my writing as I am already, hence the need for constant change.

Yeah, as of right now, I&#8217;m planning to have a live archive accessible.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t try and pull up anything nasty from it, though, or I *will* can it.&nbsp; Previously executed content could testify to that, were it still around to do so.

On that slightly morbid note, I conclude what I hope to be the last post on this blog, if all goes according to plan and transitions are relatively turbulence free.&nbsp; As another aside, I shall probably be returning to normal life tomorrow, not because I&#8217;m feeling any better, but simply because apparently I&#8217;m not permitted to be as I was.
