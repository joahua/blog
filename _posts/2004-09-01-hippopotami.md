Can apparently spend 25 minutes underwater without coming up for air. I know this because of a bottle lid of an undisclosed (and unrecalled, it&#8217;s driving me insaaaaaaaane!!!!) fruit drink.

The drink was Orange Juice, the volume of the container was 220mL, and the brand is completely beyond recollection.

Life goes on, but the hours until I can return to Woolworths Metro and check what it was bear heavily on my mind&#8230;
