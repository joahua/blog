Goodbye, 1.6GB of data I randomly downloaded yesterday. I never really meant to use you, anyway.

You know what&#8217;s really stupid, though? My iiNet quota meter only shows me as downloading 700.31MB for that day, and my average I can download per day until the end of my reset period is now sitting at a most ridiculous 716.24MB/day. Sigh.
