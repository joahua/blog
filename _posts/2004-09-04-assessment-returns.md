I&#8217;m pleased to note the success of a late night spent cramming for a Business in-class task, the fruits of which were the second highest mark in the year. That was cool. Even cooler was that my product which I developed and formulated a business plan for was required for another client, so two birds were killed with the one proverbial stone (if you knew what my product was, you&#8217;d be laughing or crying at that comment).<!--more-->

Anyhoo&#8230; I only got 25/30, which is pretty dismal for the second highest mark in the year, but apparently the assessment average was 16 and a bit, so that means it was a pretty dismal effort on everyones part. I think my night-before-doing-everything-completion-of-task may have been more effort than some others put in, but that&#8217;s pure speculation.

The real-world product has been used to pay for a domain name, amongst other things &#8212; I can now be reached over at <http://www.joahua.com/>, which I think is pretty cool. Yeah&#8230; so I&#8217;ve got a nice new domain name to play with and procrastinate more with as the yearlies draw near. Which they are doing remarkably quickly, I think.

Note to self: post my exam timetable up here some time soon&#8230; actually, bugger that, this blog isn&#8217;t going public until halfway through my yearlies anyway! Meh, we&#8217;ll see what happens&#8230;

Yeah. Speaking of procrastination, though, this weekend seems to be full of it. My goodness. Thankyou sincerely to the wonderful parentals who decided this would be an opportune time to sell the house. I&#8217;m really enjoying packing my room up and throwing out crap whilst I should be frantically trying to acquaint myself with the maths syllabus for the year. The timeliness of certain people never ceases to astound me. ARGH!!!!

Some of this stuff coming out of boxes (and going into others/the bin) really scares me. I don&#8217;t want to remember primary school. I don&#8217;t want to see how little I&#8217;ve changed!!
