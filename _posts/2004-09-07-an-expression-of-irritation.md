This post has been password protected for the past day or so, whilst this document was in draft form. In a [letter to Mr. Heath regarding William McCormack][1], I outlined the difficulties experienced thus far with this person.

All statements made in the PDF file available on this website are held to be true by myself at this point in time.

[Download the PDF version here][2]

If required, the above document can be made available in plain text format.

**UPDATE:** We&#8217;ve been [indexed][3]. The URI for the file itself is wrong, but the Google &#8220;[View as HTML][4]&#8221; link is quite snazzy. If/when Google updates their index to reflect the new location of that post, I&#8217;ll update the &#8220;View as HTML&#8221; link accordingly&#8230;
