Athletics carnival version 2 was today, and whilst less blatantly stupid than the last attempt our school put forward at such a thing, it still wasn&#8217;t great. At least the stupid half wasn&#8217;t left stuck at school, whilst the intelligent half were called in a vague attempt to make them return to that boring pointless hole when they could have been at home working far more productively on assessments, etc.

But I&#8217;m not going to start ranting about that one again, yet. Maybe later.

I ran in the 100m and came second in my heat, but it wasn&#8217;t a particulary fast race. I know this because my shoes were falling off and I still managed to come second. Alex Reid won the heat, but I doubt he was flat out, either&#8230; he got the lead at the start and then we both settled into cruise for the remaining 70m, as much as one does in short-distance races like that.

It started raining soon after, and as much as I had wanted to run, my desire to stay dry overpowered any urges to run 200m or 400m races&#8230; so I sat with people (Ben, Dale, Kylie, Max, Nick and Soolie + Crusty before they took off) quivering in the cold until the end of the day. At least it finished early ;-)

My house (that&#8217;d be Salisbury) tied in 3rd place, with the Evil Empire of York coming first, and Westminster scraping in at 8th place. Dale, it&#8217;s all your fault. Anti-participatory individual!
