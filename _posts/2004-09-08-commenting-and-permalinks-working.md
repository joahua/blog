After briefly attacking several .htaccess files, everything appears to be working in what may be described as a &#8220;normal&#8221; fashion. We&#8217;ll see if the normality lasts, as I&#8217;ve got a handful more things I wish to implement, and five days off in which I&#8217;m studying. Whilst my days will be filled with academic pursuits, my evenings have to be spent doing something, and working on this site is as good as anything else ;-)
