I&#8217;m far from 100% happy with this, and am well aware that certain aspects of the website aren&#8217;t functional, however here it is! To be honest, it was my desire to share the below post with the world which hastened the delivery of this page, however there were other reasons, also.

Just for the record, when I said I ordered &#8220;Joahua&#8221; on my Year 12 jersey for next year, I wasn&#8217;t telling the whole truth &#8212; it is in fact &#8220;Joahua.com&#8221;. Now now, be nice to the geek.

Enjoy what content is visible on the front page for the time being, until my sub-pages and permalinks start working properly, at which time you can view full articles and comment to your hearts content!

Excuse me whilst I get back to hacking the world, or at least my blog. One baby step at a time&#8230;
