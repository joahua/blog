I&#8217;d be immensely entertained if someone actually did wind up buying a house after reading about it on a blog site, but I&#8217;m posting it here more for entertainment value than anything else.

I live [here][1], in Kensington of the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, Australia. You may have where I live if you give me $AU1,150,000.

All interested parties are advised to comment using the form below&#8230; we weren&#8217;t going to auction it, but I&#8217;d be entertained if people decided to bid here, anyway. ;-)

<small>p.s. We really are selling our house, but the spot about bidding in comments is a joke. Just to clarify.</small>
