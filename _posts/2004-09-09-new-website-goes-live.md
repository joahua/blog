Or rather, went live sometime yesterday.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve posted a link to this archive from the main site, so I figured it would make sense to do the same from here, just in case people stumble upon this website in the wrong direction.

The main blog can be viewed at <http://joahua.com/blog/>.&nbsp; My name is Joahua, and I have a brand new WordPress blog.&nbsp; This isn&#8217;t a crime against humanity, contrary to popular opinion &#8212; it&#8217;s merely a better way of doing what I was already doing on this blog.&nbsp; Watch the other space for a full rant on why I&#8217;m using WordPress, instead of "rolling my own"&#8230;
