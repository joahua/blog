According to [this][1] Wired News article, there are sufficient numbers of stupid people out there to make internet advertising a feasible reality, to the point where expenditure on Online advertising media is tipped to exceed that of Print media in the next year, according to [Jupiter Research][2] &#8212; in [this][3] report, amongst others.

Sigh. I&#8217;m unaware of any websites which I frequent that use popups, even by permission &#8212; it just doesn&#8217;t seem to happen anymore! That said, perhaps I&#8217;m just visiting a cleaner, more &#8220;annoyance-aware&#8221; corner of the web than everyone else is&#8230;
