[phpSysInfo][1] is one of those apps that I don&#8217;t mind being on the bleeding edge with, because it&#8217;s non-essential, and just so damn cool at times. This new development build doesn&#8217;t look as though it has many cool new features (yet &#8212; I don&#8217;t know how long ago it forked), but hey, it&#8217;s always nice to be one of the only people out there running the latest&#8230; according to Google, as of this evening, there were only about five people it had indexed as running the phpSysInfo-2.4-cvs build. I feel special.

You can view my specialness [here][2], if you&#8217;re interested in seeing this app or what my computer is doing at any given time. That&#8217;s assuming it&#8217;s turned on/net connected, of course&#8230; dependent on myself and iiNet&#8217;s ADSL service, respectively.
