However, until the end of September (that&#8217;s 18 days away, folks), Whirlpool visitors can get the following plans from [Veritel][3], without even being bound to a contract:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Speed
    </th>
    
    <th>
      Usage limit (MB)
    </th>
    
    <th>
      $/Mth
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      256/64
    </td>
    
    <td>
      3,000
    </td>
    
    <td>
      $34.95
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      512/128
    </td>
    
    <td>
      10,000
    </td>
    
    <td>
      $44.95
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      1024/256
    </td>
    
    <td>
      20,000
    </td>
    
    <td>
      $64.95
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

These prices can be kept by anyone who signs up to them as a Whirlpool reader for as long as they want, according to Veritel&#8217;s press release, available on the Whirlpool article webpage. Ivan Hurwitz, a representative of Veritel, posted a link to a page on the Veritel website detailing how the offer works. This page is not linked to from the rest of the Veritel website, however if you&#8217;re interested, it&#8217;s available [here][5].

*Disclosure:* I&#8217;m not associated with Veritel in any way, shape or form. I just thought the offer was cool, hence the promotion. This lack of association will may cease in the next 18 days, if I decide to go with this offer, but that&#8217;s still speculation. The webpages linked to from this blog entry are available and publicised in an open forum, readable by anyone with internet access. These links are published in good faith, without any malicious intent. If Veritel desire the removal of these links, please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me.
