I laughed when I checked my inbox this afternoon after arriving home, to be greeted with an email from no other than my esteemed acquaintance Mr. William McCormack.<!--more--> As he does from time to time, he sent an email to (apparently) everyone in his address book, of course listing them all in the &#8220;To:&#8221; field. I&#8217;ll save the rant on the applications of &#8220;BCC:&#8221; for another time, but suffice to say that it&#8217;s bad netiquette in most situations.

That wasn&#8217;t the source of amusment, though&#8230; I thought the content and subject to be of far greater chuckle value. The subject of the email was &#8220;New phone number&#8221;, and the body of the email requested that this new number not be shared with any parties, as his old mobile number had apparently been subject to a  
> number of &#8216;petty&#8217; calls being made by staff which should be going through other channels</p>
Or something. I&#8217;m more inclined to think that one of the I.T. department staff had taken to pranking him incessantly, but that remains an unconfirmed rumour at this stage. ;-)

I&#8217;m rambling, though. The real source of amusement was the fact that I was included in this mailing at all, and trusted not to distribute the number <del>all over the Internet</del> to all staff members. [Someone hasn&#8217;t been keeping up with my website.][1]

<small>That said, I&#8217;m not feeling so irresponsible as to actually publish this number. I&#8217;ll admit to this much: the thought crossed my mind for more than a small moment.</small>

Gaussian blurs make life boring, don&#8217;t they? ;-)
