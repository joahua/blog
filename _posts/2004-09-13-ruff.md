Wow! The dog (which I have <del>no photo</del> no half-decent photo of, else I would link &#8212; note to self: do something about this some time) just started <!--more-->CHASING SOMETHING!!! This is soooo out of character&#8230; if it wasn&#8217;t still acting so similarly, I&#8217;d say it had been kidnapped and replaced by its 

<del>evil</del> hyperactive twin!

He&#8217;s usually something of a slob&#8230; lying around, eating, and occasionally walking (at a decidedly moderate pace), and doing nothing more. Until about twenty minutes ago. Some red thing went flying around the backyard at a speed un-naturally fast, apparently in the mouth of our dog. Cool! Haha, it appears even the DOG is trying to assist my procrastination: maths? Pfft&#8230; throw the red thing, throw the red thing!!!

I&#8217;m excited. Not as excited as the dog, though. :-P
