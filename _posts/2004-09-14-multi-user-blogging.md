In response to something written over at [Dalegroup][1] a few hours ago, a rant on multi-user blogging, and a proposition for consideration by many.<!--more-->

I agree with Dale, that this is a very interesting idea indeed. Most blogging tools support multiple users, although this is perhaps more for accountability in situations where these blogging tools are applied as a CMS-on-the-cheap than anything else&#8230;

There&#8217;d need to be some kind of theme, though. I think a <acronym title="St. Andrew's Cathedral School">SACS</acronym> blog would be a great idea, just for kicks, if you guys weren&#8217;t all leaving in a weeks time. It&#8217;d be interesting to see multiple perspectives on the same events &#8212; Dracula-esque. Stoker always was into using every text-type imaginable, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d be keen on the blog idea, were it around at his time of writing. I suppose it&#8217;s just the evolution of a text form into a more public medium.

Here is a ridiculously stupid idea, which I&#8217;m hoping everyone will think is very cool, and act upon. Just for kicks. A HSC 2004 blog, in which anyone who is in Year 12, 2004, may become a member with posting capabilities, and publish their feelings, thoughts, and opinions not only on the exams themselves (although that is perhaps the object of most interest), but also in preparation and study during your Stuvac period, in the leadup to your exams.

I&#8217;d be interested in supporting this, if enough Year 12&#8242;s would be interested in participating. Let me know what you think&#8230;
