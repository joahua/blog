Hmm. I was marginally stumped, when it came time to define the term [Bakufu][1] in an exam today &#8212; too much time spent studying for maths, I suppose &#8212; and so I wrote this, instead:

> It&#8217;s like a [Haiku][2],  
> for the less poetically inclined.

Minus the hyperlink, because [paper doesn&#8217;t lend itself too well to such things][3]. At least some poor marker will have a laugh, amidst 60 papers of the same thing, or however many there are.
