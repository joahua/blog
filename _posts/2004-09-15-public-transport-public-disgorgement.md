Apparently, one and the same. I just recieved an <acronym title="Short Message Service">SMS</acronym> message from Sam, who has apparently just had her handbag fall onto the floor of a train, into a puddle of someone elses vomit. Lovely.

On reflection, I realised I&#8217;ve never had an experience like this on Sydney&#8217;s public transport system. Admittedly, I probably don&#8217;t<!--more--> carry a 

[handbag][1] enough, but that&#8217;s another story entirely. No, seriously. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been vomited on, or even near, on public transport. I&#8217;ve been on a bus where someone at the other end urinated in their seat, and on a few more where people have been so drunk that urinating becomes a highly probable event, but it&#8217;s never actually affected me, personally. Besides, I can count those incidents on my hands and feet. Yes, I have a normal number of fingers, and toes, just for the record. Well, most days.

So, any Sydney-dwellers, what&#8217;re your experiences with such things? Is our public transport system the grossest thing since&#8230; umm&#8230; something gross? Or isn&#8217;t it so bad, aside from a few incidents which could really happen anywhere? Tim Swavley seems to think that even a train that HAS been vomited on, but cleaned up, isn&#8217;t worth riding on, judging from his escapades of earlier this week, in which he managed a new record (was it seven trains?) for the highest number of individual trains inbound to the city. He hasn&#8217;t got a blog, so I can&#8217;t hyperlink you to the full story. Harrass him in person, though. ;-)

Of course, if you&#8217;re not from Sydney, what do you think of the public transport systems (if any) in your little corner of the earth? Are such things universally gross, or have we Sydney-siders done something to deserve this especially?
