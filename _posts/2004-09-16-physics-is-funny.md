Oh dear. I just got a phone call from [school][1] which made me burst out laughing.

Apparently, I&#8217;m meant to be in a physics exam right about now. Teeheehee. I said, gleefully, that I had dropped physics some time ago, yet the change may not have come through yet, as this was officially listed on a Year 12 subject change form.

My plans to walk into that exam and have a lot of fun writing stupid yet entertaining things on the paper could have proceeded without difficulty! Muwahahahaha!

I love physics ;)
