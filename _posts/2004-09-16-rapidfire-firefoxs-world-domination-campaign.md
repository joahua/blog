Okay, so that was a lie&#8230; it&#8217;s not actually called &#8220;Rapidfire&#8221;. I think that&#8217;s a cool name, though, so they should. \*nods\* Really!

Basically, they&#8217;ve got a huge amount of unused net transfers remaining with their webhost, and are trying to make full use of it before the end of the month. Yeah, that was a lie, too. Damn, you&#8217;re good.

The bottom line is, Firefox 1.0 PR (not the pre-PR release which Asa was shouting about on the mozilla-announce mailing list a few days back) has been released, and the world is being encouraged to clamber and grab it. So much so that I&#8217;ve heard this same thing from three independent sources as I turned on my computer this morning &#8212; hey, that&#8217;s a good thing, I suppose.

Go get it, visit [Spread Firefox][1] now!
