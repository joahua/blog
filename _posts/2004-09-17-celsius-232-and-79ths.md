It&#8217;s a really good book. Short, too. I picked it up this afternoon and finished it in procrastination time and whilst on public transport, etc. If you&#8217;ve never heard of it, that&#8217;s probably because it&#8217;s usually expressed in [Fahrenheit][1].<!--more-->

Making slightly more sense, now? Maybe?

I&#8217;m sure there many others have already expressed opinions on the book, and a quick search with your [weapon][2] [of][3] [choice][4] will probably yield multitudes of synposiseseseses (synopsi?), reviews and the like.

It seemed (at least to me) to be different in the whole &#8220;bleak futurist&#8221; genre in that the book ends on a positive note. Okay, I should clarify that. It seems, at least to me, to end on a positive note, in that the valued elements established in the text survive, even though a few million people die, and&#8230; yeah. That was a spoiler, by the way. Forget the previous line now. ;-)

Something was going to be announced where this paragraph is, but I&#8217;ve decided not to, because I&#8217;m not sure enough to make that worthwhile. If I were to say I&#8217;m looking for ideas for Extension 2 next year, that&#8217;d probably allow clever cookies to surmise what I would have been considering suggesting as a theme here. But I won&#8217;t. Because I&#8217;m still liable to changing my mind several times a day for about two months still ;-)
