A technique for saving batteries.<!--more-->

Or, how exams saved batteries. Yes, that&#8217;d be it.

I just realised how long it&#8217;s been since I charged my phone. I like to think it has a decent battery life, although not as good as some, but still &#8212; it&#8217;s generally pretty good. My usual charge cycle is about 3 or 4 days, with me placing it on the charger only as it starts beeping and going into spasms saying &#8220;FEED ME!!!&#8221;. Well, not quite&#8230; you get the picture.

So when I realised that I&#8217;d last charged it on Sunday night, I was a tad suprised. The battery display meter has three segments, and it&#8217;s currently sitting on two. Phwoar. That&#8217;s Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday &#8212; We&#8217;re on Saturday. I think I&#8217;m about to make my first week without a recharge!

As I scanned the phone, my battery meter fell to one bar&#8230; still impressive. That said, given usage patterns imposed by exams this week, perhaps I should change my phones screen display message&#8230;
