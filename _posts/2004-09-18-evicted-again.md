I&#8217;m getting to hate Saturdays. The real estate dude is about to come over, and I&#8217;m going to be kicked out of the house so that random people can take a gander. For some reason, they didn&#8217;t like the idea of selling the house for Planet Banana &#8211; I have no idea why not!

The real estate guy cited problems with a commission on the sale of a planet, or something. I don&#8217;t know, [other][1] [people][2] seem to be able to do it just fine&#8230;
