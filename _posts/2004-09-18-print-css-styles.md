A friend needed a copy of an order form yesterday, so I scanned it all in, and couldn&#8217;t be bothered to PDF it. Actually, that&#8217;s not quite true. I had an itching to play with some code, so it was scratched in a way that PDF&#8217;ing wouldn&#8217;t have managed. ;-)

It&#8217;s basically just five scanned pages presented in a horizontal aspect, allowing you to scroll page-to-page as would occur on real paper, yet, by the use of the print styles I&#8217;d setup, it allows the page to be printed in a normal manner (i.e. images aren&#8217;t getting cut in half because they go off horizontally!). I&#8217;ve done a spot of work with Print stylesheets before, but this is the first exciting and relevant application I&#8217;ve had for it. There&#8217;s also a moderately workable print media stylesheet on this blog, if anyone felt so inclined.

I can&#8217;t recall if that was something which shipped with WordPress, or whether I customised it based off another website&#8230; I recall tinkering with it, but that&#8217;s about all.

If you&#8217;ve got a spare moment, click over to [here][1] and &#8220;Print Preview&#8221;. Unless you&#8217;re running Netscape 4 or something equally stupid, it should work okay&#8230; comment and let me know how it is.
