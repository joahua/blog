In the last 48 hours (or thereabouts), I&#8217;ve hit the number 1 spot on Google for a handful of terms. These are the ones I&#8217;m aware of<!--more-->:

*   [Joahua][1]
*   [Joahua Street][2]
*   [Josh Street][3]
*   [StreetComputing][4]

and probably a handful of others. Go team ego! I mean&#8230; SEO&#8230; yes. \*shuts up\*

Next up, I need to do something about &#8220;Joah&#8221;, for which I&#8217;m not even on the map, and then the ambitions for real World Domination may take over, as I work towards becoming the number one Josh and Joshua in the world! Muwahahahaha!
