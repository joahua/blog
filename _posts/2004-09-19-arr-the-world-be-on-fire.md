Even ye land-lubbers are runnin&#8217; away from Aye Eii in droves! In the last three days, over one milllion scury dogs turned to the fiery ways of [Firefox][1], the pirates browser of choice <sup>1</sup>! If ye haven&#8217;t done so, ye best be headin&#8217; off to grab it smartly like!

<small><sup>1.</sup> Excellent tool though I&#8217;m sure Firefox is for various piratical activities, neither meself nor the Mozilla team would be seen to encourage the bilge rats of the internet in their befouling ways!</small>

Yarrrrrrrr!
