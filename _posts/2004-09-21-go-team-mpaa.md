Oh dear. These people are remarkably stupid, or at least, remarkably compulsive in threatening legal action. Observe this [CNET article][1]. Can you say &#8220;auto-mailer&#8221;? Or perhaps &#8220;spam bot&#8221; would be more fitting.

By the way, just for the record, I&#8217;m a dangerous copyright lawbreaker. I promise to post more on this, soon&#8230; there&#8217;ll be a webpage stuck up about it in the near future, possibly with a list of things I have sitting illegally on my computer, such that I may attract messages of anger from the RIAA. I&#8217;ll stop now, lest the fun be revealed too soon.
