I spent two hours lying in the grass this afternoon, studying for the English modules exam tomorrow afternoon, in full sun with not a cloud to be seen. I was wishing I had a camera, but then thought &#8220;Where would I point it?&#8221;<!--more--> &#8212; a question which I could not answer. Perhaps skywards. Perhaps at the wisteria which hangs in purple splendour from the back veranda. It couldn&#8217;t capture all of it at once, though.

Photography fails to capture warmth, in the tactile sense. There is a weight to heat, which photography can convey but not replicate. I sat there, listening to music in the sun, wishing every day could feel as perfect as this did then. You know, those two hours of sun are probably the most I&#8217;ve had consecutively for&#8230; well, months now. That&#8217;s crazy. I need to get a nice lightweight [laptop][1] and a wireless base station for summer&#8230;
