An MSN conversation snippet, for your amusement, regarding frogs.<!--more-->

[21:13:44] Ben:
:   if frogs go pop in the microwave what do you think they do in the oven? 

[21:14:05] Josh:
:   gas or electric? 

[21:14:19] Ben:
:   both 

[21:14:22] Ben:
:   not at the same time, but yeah 

[21:16:00] Ben:
:   ok for example in the gas oven? 

[21:16:45] Josh:
:   well, that depends on whether the frog was directly exposed to an element or not&#8230;  
    burning frog is bad.  
    overcooked frog isn&#8217;t great, either  
    but at least it doesn&#8217;t smell immediately.  
    also, is the frog fresh from the slimy pond, or has it been cleaned first?  
    further, has it been killed whilst cleaning occurred?  
    or are we talking a live, jumping frog in the oven?  
    because it would, you know. (jump, that is)  
    right before it got cozy, and probably went to sleep, before waking up, thinking &#8220;it&#8217;s getting hot in here, i&#8217;m going to take my clothes off&#8221;, like a bad R&#8217;n&#8217;B track, before realising &#8220;hey, I&#8217;m a frog, I don&#8217;t do the whole &#8216;clothes&#8217; thing&#8221;

[21:18:35] Ben:
:   well you do know if you boil a frog from room temperature in water it doesnt realise until about 3 secods before it dies that its getting hot

[21:18:43] Josh:
:   and then starting beating on the door, screaming &#8220;LET ME OUT, LET ME OUT!&#8221;

[21:18:49] Ben:
:   hehe

[21:18:53] Ben:
:   i can see kermit doing that

[21:18:53] Josh:
:   hence, it is possible to draw THIS conclusion: &#8220;we all know frogs go &#8220;POP&#8221; in the microwave, &#8220;POP&#8221; in the microwave, &#8220;POP&#8221; in the microwave. We all know frogs go &#8220;POP&#8221; in the microwave, they don&#8217;t scream &#8220;LET ME OUT, LET ME OUT!&#8221; as they do in ovens!&#8221;

[21:20:02] Ben:
:   ahhh

[21:20:05] Josh:
:   adjust tune to suit, cook at 210degrees for 20 minutes, salt to taste.
