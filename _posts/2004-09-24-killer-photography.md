I just stumbled upon [Andy Budd&#8217;s Travel Photography][1] website, and it&#8217;s incredible, both in terms of presentation and photography/content itself.<!--more-->

Next time I&#8217;ve got a free hour or four somewhere with a Flash install (Steve?), I want to see if I can figure out a way to automate the cool presentation style he&#8217;s got happening over there, using Flash/ActionScript or something&#8230; of course, my photography is garbage compared to his work, but hey! I&#8217;m hoping something will crop up so that I can justify spending time on such a project&#8230; I can think of a few immediate applications off the top of my head, but it&#8217;s pretty unnecessary, if very cool. We shall see.

On a standards-related aside, the folks over at [Web Standards Group][2] have been clawing at each others throats for the last few days, regarding the best way to implement Flash in a standards compliant manner with XHTML. Umm. Okay, whatever. The answer, as best as I&#8217;ve understood it, is simply to revert to HTML 4.01, or just to get over it. I throughly agree with [David McKinnon&#8217;s][3] response on the issue, which I&#8217;ve reproduced in part here:

Amen.
