[Microsoft Expression][1], a free vector-based illustration application for Windows and Mac OS. I could try to run it under Wine, but I don&#8217;t think I can be bothered&#8230; [Sodipodi][2] does me just fine, most days of the week. Besides, I don&#8217;t do the whole drawing thing, sorry.

That said, I saw this over on [Veerle&#8217;s blog][3], and thought it cool enough to share. So, here it is, shared! If you&#8217;re in a position to use it, enjoy :)
