As regular or semi-regular visitors here would note, there have been various minor quirky design changes in the last several days. Most immediately evident is the new background pattern, sourced from [squidfingers][1] most excellent patterns resource. If you&#8217;re particularly attentive, you would have also noted the changes to the footer of this website.<!--more-->

Those who *aren&#8217;t* unfortunate enough to be stuck using Internet Explorer would have possibly appreciated the footer for looking kind of snazzy&#8230; for the benefit of those poor sods stuck with IE, here are some screenshots of the footer in various browsers.

### Firefox 1.0PR

I&#8217;m a fan of the way Opera handles it, personally, but I use Firefox 1.0PR at the minute for day-to-day stuff. Of course, if you&#8217;re using Internet Explorer, it should still be perfectly visible, but also boring and generally crap. Switch over! If, of course, you can&#8217;t, for one reason or another, then my sympathies to you. If you choose not to, no such apology is forthcoming! (yes, I know, personal preference&#8230; Pfft!)

Aside from the purely aesthetic, of course, there is a reason for these changes. Not for my tinkering, but for the display and presentation of content. There&#8217;s a new license in effect, you see. Well, actually, it was probably always in effect, I just never got around to making it public &#8212; the [Creative Commons license][6] this website is now formally under is that which I&#8217;d planned to use since the inception of this version of the website. So, there we go. Just for the sake of convenience, I&#8217;ve reproduced (in text-only form) the Creative Commons deed human-readable summary here.

There we go. Please, enjoy my content. You&#8217;re free to do whatever you want to it, within those constraints, but it&#8217;d be nice if you told me just so I can go take a look. That&#8217;s not a requirement of the license, of course, but it&#8217;s something I think would be nice.

If you wish to use content here for commercial purposes, or without the requirement of attribution, feel free to [get in touch][7] to discuss licensing.

Note that this licensing does not apply to content otherwise marked.
