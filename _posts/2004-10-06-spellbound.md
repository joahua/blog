I was reading Michael Heilemann&#8217;s blog, [Binary Bonsai][1] today, and stumbled across a comment linking to the website of a spell checker for Firefox, entitled &#8220;Spellbound&#8221;.<!--more--> I would normally link and pingback the post without a second thought, but I fear he&#8217;d object to my irrelevant pingback, especially given the nature of the post in which the comment lies!

\*carefully unticks &#8220;PingBack&#8221; check box\*

That&#8217;s better. The [comment in question][2] recommends [SpellBound][3] for anyone commenting on other, or operating their own, blogs. It&#8217;s a nifty little plug-in for Firefox, which checks the contents of the active textarea or field of a form when the user presses Ctrl + Shift + F7 (Cmd + Shift + F7 for Mac people), or right-clicks the area in question and selects &#8220;Check Spelling&#8221;.

I don&#8217;t need to tell you this &#8212; their webpage does it, just fine. [Usage instructions][4] are on their front page, so go download it and stop making spelling mistakes when posting content!

Now, if only someone would develop a plugin that validated the code in comments as WELL as spellchecking&#8230; my life would be perfect!

<small>(Well, not really&#8230; significantly improved, though.)</small>
