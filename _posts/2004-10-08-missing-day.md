It&#8217;s not really Friday. The gap in posting you see shouldn&#8217;t be there, because as far as I&#8217;m concerned, it still feels as though it were Thursday. That has to be one of the most compelling reasons *not* to stay up all night: simply because you don&#8217;t adequately recognise the passing of a day, and everything is thrown out completely!<!--more-->

But that, of course, wasn&#8217;t motivation enough. I&#8217;m now sitting here, having not experienced &#8220;sleep&#8221; for a tad over 36 hours. Nah, there&#8217;s no big important reason for it. Myself and Ben were at Tori&#8217;s house last night, and far too much of this time period was spent catching up on un-watched television hours (although, I am glad to say, this was comprised almost entirely of DVD watching, as opposed to real television), but hey, it&#8217;s all good. I can still safely say I haven&#8217;t watched TV proper in my own house since some time prior to the beginning of this year, so I&#8217;m happy.

Eventually the screen bored us stupid, so at about 5:30am we went on an adventure down to a children&#8217;s playground, before attacking a cluster of Sulfur Crested Cockatoos, much to their displeasure (although the noise was great!), evidenced in the numerous low-flying escapades which consequently took place above us. Scattering birds look so cool.

Ben had to go to some CSIRO programme at the [University of Sydney][1], which started at 10am. We were all feeling moderately awake, but it was predicted this situation wouldn&#8217;t continue for much longer &#8212; and, judging by what he&#8217;d said previously, Ben was expecting to be doing something tedious and boring like data entry today anyway &#8212; making him a prime candidate for falling asleep at the task!

I was supposedly meant to collect my film from a processing centre in the City at 2pm, so I was hanging around a while longer. Tori has the warmest veranda/deck/balcony thing on the face of the planet. I&#8217;m now sunburnt, but it was so nice! There were also leaves which looked like people, including one which resembled a knight bearing a lance upon a horse. I maintain that this was not yet another product of our sleep-deprived imaginations! Call it an adaption of that thing where people try and see shapes in clouds &#8212; the day was too perfect, there weren&#8217;t any clouds to look at!

I eventually left, post-sunburn, and caught a train back down to Town Hall Station, hoping that the developing people were running ahead of time and I could get my 4&#215;6&#8242;s, go home, and sleep. I failed on several counts. I &#8220;fell asleep&#8221; on the train (if the anxious &#8220;I don&#8217;t normally catch this train, where am I going? can I afford to go to sleep and miss my stop!?&#8221; sleep can count), and miraculously managed to wake up JUST as the train was pulling into Town Hall, so that much was good. The print shop still hadn&#8217;t done my film, so I drifted (quite literally) off to the City of Sydney library branch at Town Hall. I found this really cool book, which I had to fight to keep myself from falling asleep upon! In the end, I put it back on the shelf, and decided that it was probably best if I keep moving; something reading books isn&#8217;t conducive to.

Killed time walking around the city. Went to film shop. Got prints back. Went home!

And then, of course, I was overcome by a &#8220;need&#8221; to scan the photos, so hey, there goes another while. Meanwhile, in however long I&#8217;d been out, the email had amassed to the point where it was unpleasant to have to deal with (although not inherently unpleasant, the sheer volume and time required made it so), and the <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> feeds had progressively grown in &#8220;Unread&#8221; size. I want to live in a cave.

That said, there were some nice photos out of that batch. I&#8217;m feeling quite pleased with myself, truth be told, given that it&#8217;s a film SLR camera, and my first roll on it, at that. At any rate, you can judge for yourselves in a few days, as many of them shall likely end up published here, depending on requirements for usage elsewhere.

I think I&#8217;m going to go and catch up on some sleep&#8230;
