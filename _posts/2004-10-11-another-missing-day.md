I would have posted yesterday, but for the fact that I&#8217;d been screwing with DNS stuff (foolishly on my www record) yesterday, and it was most unforgiving come time to change it back. Whilst I&#8217;d normally see changes fairly quickly, this time around my ISP&#8217;s DNS servers (and presumably whatever ISP I&#8217;m using as my secondary) were excruciatingly slow to update. So, I haven&#8217;t been able to login to my admin panel, hence the lack of posting!

Hmm. Aside from that, of course, other things have been happening. Yesterday was my brother&#8217;s 8th birthday &#8212; I would say happy birthday, but he doesn&#8217;t read this, so there we go. :P We went out to Juanita&#8217;s, a great Mexican restaruant in Kensington, and&#8230; umm&#8230; ate food. As you do.

The rest yesterday was spent on a variety of things, from frantically editing CSS and the occasional graphic (all visual design work, thankfully &#8212; I&#8217;ve decided that I shouldn&#8217;t make a habit of programming, as it&#8217;s something I regularly fall flat on my face trying!) for an upcoming website, to reading Henrik Ibsen&#8217;s 1877 play, *A Doll&#8217;s House*.<!--more-->

I&#8217;m struggling to decide which was more enjoyable, too&#8230; this website features some rather well implemented gimmicky elements of design, and it&#8217;s immensely satisfying to watch come together, from paper mockup to digital reality (haha, I&#8217;d never noticed the irony in that before &#8212; funny how us web people turn even the concept of &#8220;reality&#8221; itself on its head, hey?). At the same time, *A Doll&#8217;s House* was an excellent play. I think a comparison of which is more &#8220;enjoyable&#8221; is truistic, because the play is certainly not enjoyable, even if it was incredibly worthwhile reading.

The website is currently chock-full of proprietry -moz CSS extensions, which is part of a new strategy I&#8217;m trying to cut development time. Basically, the thought behind it goes &#8220;Josh sucks when working with the GIMP&#8221;, so the idea is I use Mozilla controls to achieve visually what I want *in an electronic form*, such that what I wish to achieve is evident on screen already, and then simply go about converting that to a static graphical form. Of particular use, at least for what I&#8217;d envisaged for this design, is the Opacity property&#8230; it&#8217;s not a perfect representation of what I&#8217;ll end up with, as it effects the contents of the element it&#8217;s applied to (i.e. not JUST the background of an element), but it&#8217;s close enough for all intents and purposes.

Further into this website, I&#8217;ll post estimates as to just how much time this has saved&#8230; it&#8217;s something of an intangible, but hey, you get that.

Today&#8217;s the last day of my holidays! Ahhhhh! This has honestly been one of the shorter holiday periods of my life&#8230; ah well. I think I&#8217;m going to go and buy some more film and RAM for this computer today&#8230; I&#8217;m sick of seeing it 30% into swap, and physical usage sitting at 98%!

P.S. Mandy Moore&#8217;s song &#8220;*Only Hope*&#8221; is suprisingly good &#8212; I&#8217;d written her off as another pop queen, but I&#8217;d cite that song as proof she can sing!
