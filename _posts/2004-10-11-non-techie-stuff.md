Just to make me feel better about content balance on this website before I go to sleep.<!--more-->

How cool are dogs? I finally met Tuffy &#8220;The Man&#8221; Holloway today, Sam&#8217;s little dog, and one of the few I know which has a [website][1] dedicated to it. He is *such* an attention seeker! Very cute, though&#8230; also very fluffy. My dog, Dumbledore, currently has a short haircut, which I think I prefer&#8230; he stays clean, and doesn&#8217;t smell as bad!

The other cool thing about dogs is that even when they *do* bite you playfully, it doesn&#8217;t hurt&#8230; and, if it does, then at least they realise you&#8217;re in pain! Tori&#8217;s cat isn&#8217;t too good like that&#8230; aptly named &#8220;Psycho&#8221;, she (? I think it&#8217;s a she&#8230;) was hanging off my leg the other day, in between attempting to consume my hand. You can tell they&#8217;re related to tigers, which, incidentally, eat an average of 18 kilograms of meat a night&#8230; how insane is THAT?
