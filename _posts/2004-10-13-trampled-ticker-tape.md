Walking away from Town Hall end of the city today, there was strewn along the ground the remnants of the parade celebrating the return of Australia&#8217;s paralympians, in sweltering heat. It carried as far as Hyde Park, and not even the music could deafen the sound it made, now ignored and crushed into the ground as people continued, unknowing or uncaring where it&#8217;d been before, or even why.

I&#8217;d wished I had my camera with me, to capture the limp, insignificant and crushed green and gold paper. I&#8217;m not being cynical, it was just striking, that&#8217;s all.

Congratulations to Matt Levy and the rest of the Australian team.
