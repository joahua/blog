[Edge Strain][1] is the &#8220;cutting-room floor&#8221; of development house, [Abstract Edge][2]. Graphically brilliant, purely inaccessible (correct me if this is stated in error!), clean, smooth, polished, high bandwidth.

Some days I wish for that, others, it makes me cry. Worth a look, either way.

***Later:*** I&#8217;d like to retract comments about accessibility, if only in part.<!--more--> The website (not concept site &#8212; all further comments apply to the website of Abstract Edge, not their &#8220;cutting-room floor&#8221; display) of Abstract Edge features textual content, hidden by CSS, for non-visual 

UA. This isn&#8217;t true accessibility, so far as I&#8217;m concerned, because there are many, many users who would benefit from accessible design who fall outside the &#8220;non-sighted&#8221; umbrella.

For example, those on dialup. This website is LOCKED into displaying Flash content only (at least without fiddling with a few things most users wouldn&#8217;t know about, or bother to), unless you&#8217;re using a web browser which doesn&#8217;t support CSS. This presents a problem in terms of bandwidth, if nothing else.

Motor disabilities? You may have the Flash player installed, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;d be your first choice. If you can&#8217;t click links because of crazy flying menus inside Flash applications, a text version is certainly preferable. Not only that, even most pure Flash websites don&#8217;t include a scaling facility (despite this being an inherent capability of Flash, as a vector-based platform), which obviously means those with visual disabilities (not blindness, just short-sightedness) can&#8217;t scale content &#8212; something which is possible in most UA these days with pretty much all text content.

Perhaps it doesn&#8217;t suit their target, but I don&#8217;t know. The &#8220;You can&#8217;t enter our website unless you have Flash Player 7&#8243; grated at my nerves a little, as I couldn&#8217;t see anything about the site/animation which I didn&#8217;t know *could* be achieved without much difficulty in Flash 5, even. That, and the half-baked attempt at &#8220;being accessible&#8221;, seemingly more out of token effort than actual well-founded motivation&#8230; well.

At least it looks pretty.
