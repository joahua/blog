On the [9th of September][1], I announced that my current place of residence was [for sale][2]. Slightly more than one month later, it has been sold for $AU1,000,000.<!--more-->

It appears that offer was more palatable than Planet Banana to the owners, something which causes me infinite displeasure. I would have rather liked Planet Banana.

And yes, that is a full $AU150,000 shy of the initial listing price, but that&#8217;s what happens when people place unrealistic expectations, and attempt to assume their own expertise in such matters. If I recall correctly, [the agency][3] recommended we list at $1,100,000, but the male parental unit decided that $1,150,000 was a better idea. That worked well&#8230;

Anyway. It&#8217;s sold. I&#8217;ll probably get all nostalgic and wind up taking lots of photos. Maybe.
