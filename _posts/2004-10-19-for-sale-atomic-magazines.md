I&#8217;m clearing out various cupboards, to make moving less painful, and I&#8217;ve got the first thirty-eight issues of the Australian computer magazine, [Atomic][1] sitting there, doing very little. It&#8217;s a shame to see them sitting unread and unappreciated, so I&#8217;m offloading them to&#8230; well, whoever wants them.

If you&#8217;d like to buy them (preferably as a single lot), feel free to get in contact, either by means of the [contact form][2], or the comments field below. In the interests of full disclosure, I&#8217;ve also advertised the same on the Atomic forums, under a post entitled [&#8220;FS: Atomic 1 &#8211; 38 inclusive (Sydney)&#8221;][3].

Failing anyone wanting to purchase them (at whatever amount you&#8217;d think is reasonable &#8212; I&#8217;m fairly flexible), I&#8217;ll donate them to my public library, assuming they&#8217;ll take them (they&#8217;ve already taken my APC magazine pile a few months back).

***Update:*** Issue 38 and corresponding CD has been sold. Issues 1 through 37 remain for sale.
