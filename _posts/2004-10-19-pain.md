English teachers should not use the symbol for &#8220;at&#8221; (namely &#8220;@&#8221;) in place of the characters &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;t&#8221; for anything but denoting email addresses. Not when working with print media, and not when writing on paper. Please.

<small>I already have too little respect for certain members of the St. Andrew&#8217;s teaching staff. You don&#8217;t need to reinforce my opinions.</small>
