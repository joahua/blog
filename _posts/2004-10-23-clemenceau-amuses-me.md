Despite being struck by the freedom of expression permitted in America when he visited it in the 1860s, Clemenceau was later recorded as saying this of America:

> America is the only nation in history which miraculously has gone directly from barbarism to degeneration without the usual interval of civilization.

Amusing, but hardly consistent.
