Whilst [this SMH article][1] is discussing something completely different, I was interested (perhaps saddened?) to learn that there is a sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean in the works. That sucks!<!--more-->

What is it with the movie industry and milking successful movies these days? Of course, I&#8217;d go and see the sequel, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;d be able to make it anywhere near as good as the first!

<img src="/blog/wp-content/2004/10/hydepark.jpg" alt="Hyde Park." style="float:right;" />The only exception to this rule, of course, are films which are never intended to stand alone, drawing from a rich (or not so rich) background of film material in order to create parody. That&#8217;s okay. Again, sequels are still bad, but following up a concept isn&#8217;t. I saw Shaun of the Dead last night with Tori and Ben, and it has to be one of the funnier movies I&#8217;ve seen for some time now &#8212; especially given the ever-so-slightly twisted genre employed.

After the movie, we went drifting around the city for another two hours or so, visiting the most excellent &#8220;[Sydney Life][2]&#8221; exhibition in Hyde Park, as part of Sydney&#8217;s &#8220;[Art and About][3]&#8221; event this year. There&#8217;s a series of canvases strung up along the main pathway in Hyde Park North (today is the last day it&#8217;s up), with prints which are about 4 meters wide. My favorite was either &#8220;[The True House][4]&#8221; or a piece inspired by A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream, &#8220;[Midsummer Eve][5]&#8220;. Tori stood staring at &#8220;[Mark][6]&#8221; for ages, so I guess that&#8217;d be her favorite, and Ben seemed to have an affinity for &#8220;[Heath Training][7]&#8221; , although I may be wrong.

If you&#8217;re around the city this afternoon, and they haven&#8217;t taken them down yet, go take a look: it&#8217;s worth it.
