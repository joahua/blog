Given the slightly derisive comments my shift to WordPress attracted, I find this shift mildly amusing to say the least! That said, go check it out at [ucosty.net][1].<!--more--> The design is a little Kubrick-ish, which is being horrifically overused all over the Internet &#8212; not that it&#8217;s a bad design, but the lustre of originality is starting to wear somewhat.

Having said that, the design may be entirely original, merely drawing inspiration from Kubrickesque websites &#8212; It&#8217;s well implemented, of course, but my criticism in that regard stands.

Now, get some content up!
