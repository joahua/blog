Some of you may recall images I had of my favorite stuffed toy, Tux, a while back. Well, there&#8217;ve been a few iterations of my website since, but I&#8217;m still moderately entertained by the whole thing. With that in mind, the images, along with plot embedded in ALT descriptions, have been posted on my Photography page.

[See what Tux got up to&#8230;][1]
