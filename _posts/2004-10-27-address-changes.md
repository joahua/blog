Following on from the previous post [in which I panicked][1] about such things, I&#8217;ve taken action with regards to the physical mailing address situation.<!--more-->

I&#8217;ve registered a post office box, and it&#8217;s requested that all written correspondence be directed to:

**P.O. Box 536  
KENSINGTON 1465**

As yet, I don&#8217;t have anywhere to live certainly, but at least my mail won&#8217;t get lost. I&#8217;ve updated my domain contact details this afternoon, so that should be up-to-date &#8212; I have no idea how long these things take to propagate/change, so we&#8217;ll see. As of 1702 Eastern Standard Time, I&#8217;m still getting the old records on my whois lookups here. Tomorrow, time to see banks and other such organisations&#8230; I can&#8217;t wait </sarcasm>
