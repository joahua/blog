I just uploaded (as in, about 20 minutes ago) a new roll of film to the [photography section][1], as an album entitled &#8220;[The City, Zetland and friends][2]&#8220;.<!--more-->

Some of the photographs are garbage, but one of the things an antique film SLR camera doesn&#8217;t give you is auto focus, so that&#8217;s more than part of it! The photographs of [Tuffy][3], [for example][4], were taken with absolutely no control or predictability of the movement of the subject. They&#8217;re necessarily poor, because I need to learn that kind of rapid control sometime, and now is as good as ever.

Favorites? Mine is either that of [captured salt][5] between windows of a train, or the [Centerpoint silhouette][6] (I love those clouds!).
