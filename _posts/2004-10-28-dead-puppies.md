This morning, when someone was unable to stop laughing:

> Think about dead puppies!
> 
> &#8211; Lucy

<!--more-->This, of course, only further pushed people into hysterics.

Later today, when someone *else* was unable to stop laughing:

> Think about dead puppies! &#8230; Works every time!
> 
> &#8211; Lucy

The first instance included a few more words, which made the second far more amusing than perhaps it should have been. Guess you had to be there?
