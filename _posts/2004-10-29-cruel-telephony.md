In a cruel twist of fate (or at least Orange&#8217;s network rollout and upgrade roadmap policy), reception in what used to be blackspots around my house has improved dramatically in the last 48 hours.<!--more-->

I&#8217;d been waiting to see whether this could last before posting, and now, as it seems that it has, I do so. Those who follow my life as published in this space will be aware of the plans to vacate the current place of residence to move elsewhere: naturally, as this has been confirmed, mobile coverage here improves!

There isn&#8217;t really all that much more to say, other than that my bedroom used to be a no-go area for making phone calls on my mobile, but now works fine&#8230; I hope the coverage wherever we move to is as good!
