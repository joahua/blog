And today, it&#8217;s Australia being ridiculous: [Whirlpool Forums &#8211; Thread: Wireless AP draws ASIO][1]. If this ends up going to air, I&#8217;ll make sure I watch TV for once.

Watch out, this guy is trying to kill his whole neighbourhood with 2.4GHz microwave technology! I setup a friend&#8217;s wireless broadband modem/router/access point over the phone last night: I&#8217;m expecting the cops to knock on my door any moment for collusion with terrorists.
