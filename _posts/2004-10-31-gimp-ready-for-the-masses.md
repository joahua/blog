I&#8217;ve been absolutely amazed this evening by what can be achieved by a non-technical user with [The GIMP][1] as a creative tool.<!--more-->

Kim Pounder is a remarkable artist when equipped with pen and paper, as those who know her may be aware. Those who aren&#8217;t, I&#8217;d advise [visit her gallery][2] some time. You&#8217;ll note a handful of coloured works in there, amongst the sketches and black and white art: this is attributed by her to a lack of software (for the purposes of colouring and shading).

Kim isn&#8217;t Linus Torvalds. She&#8217;s moderately computer literate, but not any more so than most. If nothing else, I thought it would be a great usability *experiment* to suggest she use The GIMP for editing and colouring her artwork digitally, instead of recommending the typically accepted software, Photoshop or Illustrator. Essentially, financial reasons meant that neither application was a viable option for her, and I wasn&#8217;t about to advocate piracy.

At this point, I recommended The GIMP to her, and offered download links&#8230; which, for whatever reason, weren&#8217;t working for her. So I downloaded The GIMP and GTK+ packages for Windows, burnt them to CD (haha, no, I didn&#8217;t bother with including the program source code! Kim, you&#8217;re most welcome to the source code if you desire it &#8212; there, GNU compliance!), and physically gave it to her. A few days later, not only has the application been installed and configured (those of you who have installed The GIMP recently may recall a screen DPI calibration utility which must be negotiated), she&#8217;d also managed to use the tool to colour, using an airbrush, the &#8220;[Woodland Fae][3]&#8221; illustration.

Take that, those who condemn the usability of Open-Source applications! I&#8217;ll admit it&#8217;s not up to the same interface standards as those of Adobe, but then this project doesn&#8217;t (to the best of my knowledge) have any full-time sponsored employees working on it, either. Oh, yeah, and it&#8217;s free.

*The GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a freely distributed piece of software for such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image authoring. It works on many operating systems, in many languages.*

*The GIMP for Windows may be downloaded from <http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/> free of charge. Unix binaries and source code archives are available directly from the official website of The Gimp, <http://www.gimp.org/>.*
