An&#8230; *interesting* poem, composed in English by <span style="color:#700;">Louis</span>, <span style="color:#007;">Kristen</span> and <span style="color:#070;">Tori</span>.<!--more-->

> <span style="color:#700;">Die, bitch<br /> May your days be filled with insufferable pain</span>  
> <span style="color:#007;">It&#8217;s not like I ate my sister&#8217;s brain<br /> She deserved it, stupid horse</span>  
> <span style="color:#070;">I&#8217;ve decided to eat her, pass the sauce!<br /> Kristen is a Novotel</span>  
> <span style="color:#700;">Tori is a Novotel as well.<br /> The hotel industry is huge</span>  
> <span style="color:#007;">Ebenezer Scrooge<br /> is pegging pegs on Josh</span>

There is no rational explanation for any of this.
