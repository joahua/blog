For the first time in a while, thought I&#8217;d update the masses on what&#8217;s been happening with the traffic situation in this part of the world recently.<!--more-->

On the [sixteenth of this month][1], I launched a new [photography section][2] on this website. Clearly, this has potential to do crazy things with bandwidth usage, and, to an extent, it did.

Raw numbers. The month before last (September), I used 173.25MB of bandwidth. Whilst October may be one day longer, that alone doesn&#8217;t account for the difference in bandwidth usage: I used 327.00 MB this month, up 153.75MB from the previous month &#8212; nearly doubling transfers. Meanwhile, the total number of pages served *fell*, from 21,831 to 19,731 &#8212; this isn&#8217;t indicative of a fall in visits, however, with an increase from 459 to 583 unique visitors in this same period. Speaking of hits (which I put little weight on), there was a slight increase from 32740 to 36006.

Whilst I don&#8217;t have reliable browser statistics for both September and October, there appears to be little change overall &#8212; both Firefox and Internet Explorer demonstrate increases between the two months, however the stats package wasn&#8217;t properly configured to detect Firefox as Firefox for most of September, so those numbers are far from reliable.

Overall Windows traffic has increased around 10%, which basically means I&#8217;m visiting this website less (or, more to the point, that others are visiting it more): to the best of my knowledge, none of &#8220;the regulars&#8221; run Linux on the desktop.

Search engine referrals are up from 37 hits from Google in September to a (comparatively) enormous 201 hits in October over the same period. Right up there are keywords such as &#8220;Skype&#8221; and &#8220;Freetel&#8221; &#8212; especially Freetel. That one seems to have attracted some interest, if not in posted comments, then in personal email/contact form communications.

Since switching this website over to [WordPress][3] in early September/late August, I&#8217;ve increased the number of monthly visits six fold (approximately), and my bandwidth usage by about four. There you have it: WordPress increases your visitors! Hehehehe. It&#8217;s conclusive&#8230;

Oh, and whoever is continuing to visit this website by the old sc.dalegroup.net or streetcomputing.tk addresses (which I shall NOT link), please wake up and start using my domain name, <http://www.joahua.com/>. Thankyou. Referrals from an external page which is my own are starting to irritate me.

In the first seventeen hours of this month, I&#8217;ve attracted 8 hits from search engines so far: yes, Freetel was at least one of the search terms.
