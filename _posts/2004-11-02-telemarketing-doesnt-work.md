Less so than email spam does, in that you&#8217;re reaching a comparatively limited audience and are less likely to hit susceptible people. Oh, yeah, and with email, it&#8217;s more likely to be utterly disregarded in the flood of other garbage, but with the &#8216;phone, you&#8217;re required to take notice, and, subsequently, offense.

I cite [Eric Meyer][1] as a [key example][2] of why telemarketing sucks, more so than email spam. Good work, regardless as to whatever political convictions you may have.
