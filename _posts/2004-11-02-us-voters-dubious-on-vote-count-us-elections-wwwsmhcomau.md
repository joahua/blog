[US voters dubious on vote count &#8211; SMH][1].<!--more-->

> &#8220;These findings are appalling,&#8221; said Adam Clymer, the survey&#8217;s political director. &#8220;If there is one thing the government in a democracy should be able to assure, it is an accurate vote count, and assure it so firmly that people will expect it.&#8221;

Someone (I think in the Real World, not online&#8230; apologies if I&#8217;ve read this somewhere else and not attributed appropriately) proposed U.N. inspectors be sent to oversee the vote, as in nations where the integrity of voting processes is at stake. Seems to me that may not be such a bad idea: certainly, that&#8217;d be better than the [armies of lawyers][2] from both key parties: the article linked suggests that &#8220;Democrats plan to field 10,000 lawyers tomorrow, with the Republican total not far behind.&#8221;
