Several days ago now [I posted][1] regarding a story [first published on Whirlpool][2], then making appearances on websites such as [The Register][3] (and probably others), which details a heinous act of terrorism taking place: and not on the part of the man who put up the Access Point, but rather by the enforcement agencies, who (so it is suggested) were intimidating in their dealing with the &#8220;offender&#8221;.<!--more-->

To me, that constitutes an act of terrorism, albeit on a reduced scale &#8212; state-published propaganda is arguably inspiring a greater sense of terror and a need for compliance than any so-called &#8220;Acts of Terrorism&#8221; are (at least in Australia). It should perhaps come as no surprise, then, to learn that agents of the Terror (I do not speak of the French Revolution) are actively searching for sympathising opinions with these *victims* of terrorism.

Last month, this website attracted a total of *two* hits from addresses in the `.mil` TLD namespace: so far this month (we stand but three days into it), there have been twenty-two impressions thus far, as of 04:34 this morning. To clarify, my daily impressions remain relatively consistent with last month &#8212; the total number of hits remains relatively static. Proportionally, this is an enormous increase in namespace hits from military networks.

One can only assume that comments made regarding terrorism have been the reason for attracting traffic of this variety. Whilst I don&#8217;t consider anything published here to be (overly) inflammatory, I intend to stand by the existing policy of maintaining content in its&#8217; entirety, unless compelling legal reason (or *reasonable* request) is given to remove it: In this event, the content shall be altered to denote it as changed (or, potentially, censored).
