Don&#8217;t see the movie &#8220;Hero&#8221;, unless you enjoy constant martial arts fighting with rather poor chroma key work, disjointedly linked to a vague suggestion of plot, which consists of the retelling of three alternate versions of a story leading to an event which does not happen.

The hero is riddled with arrows as a traitor, and given a hero&#8217;s burial. There, a spoiler. Now you don&#8217;t need to see it, do you?
