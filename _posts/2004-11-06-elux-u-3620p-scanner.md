I&#8217;ve acquired a new scanner today, namely, an Elux U-3620P flatbed. A quick web search reveals illiterate teenagers swearing about a lack of drivers for Windows XP (at least, I hope these people aren&#8217;t considered literate and mature in&#8230; well&#8230; any society on the planet), and a whole lot of not-much information about the actual capabilities/performance of the scanner.<!--more-->

Elux apparently went out of business (cause undetermined) a few years ago, so they don&#8217;t have a useful website full of specifications which I can check, either. The whinging would suggest that these scanners are slow and deliver poor image quality, but I&#8217;m not compelled to believe them without seeing this thing working first. Which, incidentally, can&#8217;t happen just yet, because the only cable I have which&#8217;d connect it nicely happens to be packed away in a box taped shut.

Speaking of cables, though, I find it most curious that this device *does not have a visible DC power inlet*! I&#8217;ve been told to &#8220;look harder&#8221; by various people&#8230; but, at this stage, I seriously can&#8217;t see it at all! If it weren&#8217;t all single piece construction, I&#8217;d take it apart to prove it&#8230; that said, it *is* single piece constructed, and I&#8217;d rather wait until I had a cable to prove or disprove my point rather than break it trying to discover before-hand.

This is all based on the premise that there is some form of Linux driver support for the damn thing&#8230; if not, I&#8217;d presume there are Windows 9x drivers out there, somewhere, but I&#8217;d really rather not. One of the reasons I suspect it (the scanner) was performing slowly for aforementioned illiterates, is that they were running on a system with a parallel port which made everything grind to a halt when used. This isn&#8217;t a problem on my main desktop, but on some of the 9x boxes, it certainly would be!

I&#8217;ll see if I can hunt down a spare parallel cable some time this week, and then give it a whirl with XSane (or \*shudder\* Twain). Worst case scenario, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s something crazy I can do with the lights inside a scanner&#8230; we shall see.
