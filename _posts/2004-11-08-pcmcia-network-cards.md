Don&#8217;t suppose anyone has one lying around that they want to sell, or knows where to get them cheaply? Wired ethernet or wireless 802.11b (or c,d,e,f,g,&#8230;x,y,z &#8212; whatever&#8217;s in flavour this month), I&#8217;m pretty indifferent. My Xircom ethernet card has gone walkies (I have absolutely NO idea where it is&#8230; that isn&#8217;t something I&#8217;d have packed, either), and I want connectivity on my laptop.

The USB drive has gone some way to alleviating the pain, but still, it&#8217;s not as good as direct access to my network, especially in terms of live editing of remote sites&#8230; not that I&#8217;d ever do such a thing! Best practice be damned. ;-)

Yes&#8230; if anyone has one they want to lend/sell (even if it&#8217;s only 10Mbit, that&#8217;s fine), then [get in touch][1] via the contact form, or just email me.
