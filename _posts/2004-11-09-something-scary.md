I&#8217;m the number 1 match for &#8220;HSC stimulus&#8221; (with or without quotation marks) on Google at this point in time. After that, there&#8217;s [Dale&#8217;s post in which a picture of a burning stimulus booklet is displayed][1]. What&#8217;s scary, is that I&#8217;m ranked higher than the Board of Studies website, and CSU&#8217;s HSC Online website for the un-quotation-mark-encapsulated search term!

Fortunately, the search query &#8220;HSC stimulus *booklet*&#8221; (sans quotes) returns normal matches on the first page, with my complaint about the difficulty of photocopying the stupid thing coming up on page two (of 34, but hey).

PageRank weightings obviously can&#8217;t always be a good thing, if this kind of irrelevant content can be dragged up because of it! (I assume that&#8217;s what it was, anyway&#8230;)
