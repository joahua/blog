Firefox 1.0, the standalone web browser taking the world by storm, has been released today amidst much anticipation from the Internet community at large. This standards-compliant, secure and cross-platform browser has, even before its final version 1 release, received more than **eight million** downloads globally.

If you haven&#8217;t already made the switch, visit <http://getfirefox.com/> and rediscover the web today!

I&#8217;ve got a moderately large poster (sized somewhere between A3 and A2) printed out, and plan on propaganda-ing my part of UNSW tomorrow morning&#8230; if you&#8217;ve got nothing better to do with your time tomorrow, engage in some propaganda-ing of your own!
