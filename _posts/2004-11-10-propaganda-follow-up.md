I&#8217;m excited. The sign I&#8217;d prepared (A4 x 6) was stuck up outside the office today, was seen by most people passing through level 2 (it&#8217;s a fairly high-traffic area), and resulted in me personally installing Firefox on a computer of someone who&#8217;d never heard of it before.<!--more--> The signage consisted of an 

[enormous-ish logo][1] (PDF, 274.1<acronym title="KiloBytes">KB</acronym>), and a smaller sheet which read:

> Firefox 1.0
> 
> http://getfirefox.com/
> 
> Rediscover the web!

&#8230;in moderately enormous letters.

So, rest assured, more people than this one guy saw it. The only reason he asked what it was is because we were installing a wireless VPN client on his PC, and was wondering what the sign outside was for. I whipped out my USB flash drive, and Firefox was installed in under two minutes. Bang.

Next time someone comes up complaining about their WLAN password or whatever it is not working, I&#8217;m considering saying that it&#8217;s because their client software is [insecure][2], and they should install [another][3] [browser][4]. Of course, the next step would be to actually fix whatever their problem was, but still&#8230; muwahahaha!

Oh, the wonders of frontline tech assistance!

<small>As an aside, I&#8217;m impressed by the penetration of Firefox in this environment already. Admittedly, it&#8217;s something of a CSE and generic Engineering degree breeding ground, but still&#8230; other faculties are fairly well represented, too, and people still seem to have a Firefox icon on their desktop. Whether they <em>use</em> it is another issue altogether, of course, but the install-base exists, at least!</small>
