All three items mentioned in the title of this post have, fortunately, nearly no connection, aside from the fact that they&#8217;re all prevailing influences in my life at the moment. Well, okay, the ACCC isn&#8217;t a &#8220;prevailing influence&#8221;, but it&#8217;s being thought of.<!--more--> Those of you following the &#8220;

[Dear Microsoft][1]&#8221; thread will possibly understand what I&#8217;m referring to: It&#8217;s been updated today, following a phone call from the ACCC. Head over there to find out more, because I don&#8217;t care to repeat myself elsewhere&#8230; it&#8217;ll only confuse search engines, Microsoft, the ACCC and myself (although not necessarily in that order).

The house-finding thing is yet to be tied up, unfortunately&#8230; this means I&#8217;m going to be moving not once, but twice (at a minimum) in the coming weeks (months). More glad than ever about that PO Box, now. The moves shall be punctuated by a cruise to miscellaneous Islands, which should be an enjoyable experience, although I&#8217;m planning on taking copious quantities of books and reading my way through it: there&#8217;s only so much you can do on a boat, after all. That, and there are a handful of assessments of which I have already received notification for next year, for which reading is fortunately requisite. Oh, yeah, and the whole final year of school slash HSC thing means this holiday is probably the last chance I&#8217;ll have to read for about 12 months&#8230; yes, advantage shall be taken!

Speaking more immediately, my goal is to make it to the weekend alive &#8212; I&#8217;ve got an oh-so-slightly menacing Modern assessment (a speaking task at that, ahhh!!!) due Friday, which I&#8217;m stressing a little about, and then a (completely insubstantial) proposal due for my Extension 2 major work (that&#8217;d be English) on Monday &#8212; I say &#8220;completely insubstantial&#8221; because it&#8217;s only 1,500 words, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m stressing any less about it!

As per usual, regardless as to whether or not anyone is actually *interested* in reading my submitted work, I&#8217;ll probably end up posting either a complete or somewhat abridged version of at least the Extension 2 proposal here&#8230; the Modern&#8230; well, perhaps. I note with some disdain that the Wikipedia article entitled &#8220;[Paris Peace Conference, 1919][2]&#8221; is, in the wiki-vernacular, a stub&#8230; I may contribute to there once all this is over, not because I consider myself to be particularly knowledgeable, but simply because *some* content is better than none! (Assuming aforementioned content is accurate, which I sincerely hope it is!)

Reading between the lines of this post probably yields a message stating that Josh doesn&#8217;t have time (or the resources) to post in the immediate future, so anticipate a slow-down. Whilst that&#8217;s one possible reading of this post, I don&#8217;t know that&#8217;s entirely true. I&#8217;ll have to wait and see, as will everyone else!
