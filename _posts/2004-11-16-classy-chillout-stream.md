I stumbled upon this gem the other day, and thought I&#8217;d share it. It&#8217;s a 256kbit (although more boring 128, 48 and 32k flavoured streams are available) chillout radio &#8216;cast, from [Radio Max][1] in Hungary. Worried about it being in Hungarian? Man, it&#8217;s chillout! Just&#8230; chill with it&#8230;

\*watches ADSL link chill with it, and smiles\*
