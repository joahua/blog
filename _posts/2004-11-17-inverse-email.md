I&#8217;ve decided that quantities of email received must have a direct inverse relationship with my workload at any given point of time. The amount of email I&#8217;d been receiving had dropped below the 100 a day mark (not by much, but still! an improvement&#8230;) a few weeks ago, something I&#8217;d not really minded that much, but could have dealt with previous quantities without any substantial difficulty, given how much (or how little!) I was doing in terms of assessments and the like.

Well, guess who got about 150 emails today, in the midst of two moderately substantial assessments? Doh. Yes, I do read them all. Except for those tagged [iiSpam], which I ignore altogether, by virtue of the fact that I don&#8217;t even see them (on account of a series of filters I&#8217;ve got happening). Mercifully, only about 25 of those were spam, which was a pleasent surprise &#8212; and, of them, only five slipped through the various filtering that happens around here. Snazzy, no? Shame about the timing&#8230;
