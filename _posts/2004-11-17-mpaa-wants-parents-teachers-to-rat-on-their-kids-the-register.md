[MPAA wants parents, teachers to rat on their kids | The Register][1]

The reality isn&#8217;t as bad as the title would suggest, but still. There&#8217;s nothing like a Stalinist reference to make people jump up and down in paranoia. Except perhaps a Hitler Youth reference. Or a Nineteen Eighty Four reference.

You get the idea. The article is horrendously overstated, but the point still stands. Personally, I&#8217;m interested to run the software, just for kicks. I can&#8217;t wait until they bring out a Linux version of it!

\*sits back in anticipation\*
