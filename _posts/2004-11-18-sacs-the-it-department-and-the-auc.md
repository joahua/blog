[ SACS the IT department and the AUC][1]

I, of course, had no part in any of this, as such a thing would be totally uncharacteristic and inconceiveable. I can see ASIO come running, now!

<small>I&#8217;ll stop making bomb threats, some day. Like, when someone seriously misunderstands the intent behind a comment I make, and the AFP come knocking down my door in the middle of the night. Hasn&#8217;t happened, yet.</small>
