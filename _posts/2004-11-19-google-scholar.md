[Google Scholar][1], a utility released by Google for the purposes of research, looks moderately cool, and even more useful. First impressions are that there is a lot of high-ranking fee-for-full text websites on it, which is a shame, and somewhat defeats the purpose of it as an application for research &#8212; having said that, it does look useful for identifying relevant texts, criticisms, and other works which reference the same (thus, in some spanning manner, broadening the scope of material which may be investigated).

The &#8220;sites which reference this&#8221; thing is probably the coolest part of it all, I would think. I&#8217;ll play with it some more tomorrow some time.
