Just to continue on an academic theme (heavily reflective of my recent life, in terms of workload&#8230;), I&#8217;m winding up my propsal for English Extension 2. As happens on a regular-ish basis here, I plan on posting the full text of the final document, once it becomes final. Until then, I&#8217;d love you if you could read [the current draft][1] (<acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym>, 31<acronym title="Kilo Bytes">KB</acronym>) and comment &#8212; please, don&#8217;t hesitate to say it&#8217;s poorly written/detailed/whatever; I&#8217;ve got a full day and a bit before it&#8217;s due, so there&#8217;s plenty of time left to re-write it!

Seriously, though; criticisms on the proposal itself are fine &#8212; criticisms of what it is actually *proposing* (content/plot) are not helpful at this stage. By all means, feel free to ask me why I plan on doing what that document suggests I&#8217;m spending the next 8-9 months working on, but don&#8217;t try and get me to change it &#8212; at least, not until after 8:30am Monday, when all this is over, and I can go back to being existing without worrying what the marking guidelines for breathing are like.

<small>In the interests of accessibility, those unable to read PDF documents for whatever reason are invited to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>, so that I may publish a text-only (XHTML formatted) version of the document here. In the interests of preserving my sanity and time, this shall <em>only</em> be done if someone requires it &#8212; don&#8217;t let that stop you from asking, though.</small>
