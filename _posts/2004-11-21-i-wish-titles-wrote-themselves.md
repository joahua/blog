Hmm. Just finished (as in printed, stapled, backed up ad infinitum and then shoved into a bag to be dealt with later) that proposal, which I am now refusing to read again, on the basis that, having glanced at it as it printed, the document doesn&#8217;t seem anywhere near as good in hard copy. So I don&#8217;t really want to know about it.

In other news, I&#8217;m down to two computers now, as everything else has been packed. The printer is about to go, too, now that I&#8217;ve finished this assessment off. My room remains in a state of anarchy. This is to be dealt with&#8230; now.
