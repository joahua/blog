I haven&#8217;t got time to post (and likely won&#8217;t properly for a few weeks, at least &#8212; my email may also be out for a period of a few days, depending on transition), due to work and moving and everything else, but I thought I&#8217;d share a couple of photos (completely unrelated).

This first one comes from my Firefox propaganda-ing escapades, which was mildly successful in my mind. Yes, that is someone crashed out on the desk in the background&#8230;  
![A photograph of the Firefox logo stuck on a wall outside the IT helpdesk at the University of New South Wales.][1]

And this one, of my esteemed friend, [Michael Dale][2] &#8212; so esteemed, in fact, that we shoved him in the boot of a car for transport on his 18<sup>th</sup> birthday!

Hey, it was a big boot!
