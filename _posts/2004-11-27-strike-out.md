An amusing &#8212; and interesting &#8212; read, over at a webpage entitled [[strike out]][1]. Yet another case for Adobe PDF as a document distribution standard? Microsoft stubbornly continue to be one of the few remaining (large) IT companies who persist in using software designed for authoring, not redistribution, over the PDF format.

Cool though this feature of Word may be, it&#8217;s a shame the creators (speaking of Microsoft as a collective, not individual programmers) of this software have to be so ignorant&#8230;
