As previously mentioned, there has been a relocation of sorts occurring in these parts over the last several days, during which time I have lived a most unusual kind of life.<!--more--> As always, &#8220;unusual&#8221; is entirely subjective, and pertains only to my normal pattern of existence. Incidentally, existence is one of those words I&#8217;m never sure if I&#8217;m spelling correctly or not&#8230; and generally can&#8217;t be bothered to check, more so now. For a few reasons. One, I&#8217;m trying to conduct other work whilst composing this message, and asides such as 

[dictionary.com][1] consume far too much time and/or effort &#8212; I will inevitably end up flicking to the thesaurus, and spend hours devouring various information about synonyms and antonyms, and, if I drift back to [dictionary.reference.com][1], where I further immerse myself in all kinds of other mindless (or perhaps not so mindless, but certainly not relevant to the task at hand) reading.

ANYWAY. Asides are bad. Enjoyable, but a vice of sorts.

So, I last posted on [Tuesday][2]. After I&#8217;d scanned, resized, uploaded and posted those two images (alas, there is no wonderful digital camera technology at work here, a fact which brought me great discomfort as I discovered that a roll of 24 had misfed, and I had captured 24 shots of nothingness!), the two remaining computers were reduced to one &#8212; and even that was packed neatly into a bag to be transported. My regular Linux monstrosity now sits in storage, as does everything but the laptop I now type on. Incidentally, I have located the Xircom network adapter for this thing &#8212; the means by which I now communicate with the world (other credits go to Telstra BigPond cable, and a nifty patch panel and the like&#8230; more on that, later.) &#8212; so that was good.

*Aside: Thanks for loan of your PCMCIA card, Dale :) Unfortunately, Windows ME didn&#8217;t play nicely with default drivers, and I eventually gave up&#8230; I&#8217;ll get it back to you sometime in the near future!*

And so most of my life was packed. I filled one more box, cleared up miscellaneous garbage, threw a bit more stuff out, taped some boxes shut, discovered I&#8217;d left my bin unpackaged, couldn&#8217;t be bothered re-opening boxes, and subsequently left the bin to do whatever it would in storage. It&#8217;s a mildly unexciting object, so I figured I may just buy a new one upon finally moving to a new place of (more) permanent residence. And then I fell asleep, too late at night (or morning?).

Which, so it seems, has been the story of my week &#8212; I started on 5 hours sleep, then managed to get about the same every night until Thursday, when I got home, collapsed into bed with my head about to implode (or explode, or something&#8230;), and didn&#8217;t awake until the next morning; I got up for about half an hour, then fell back into bed until the next morning.

It&#8217;s hit Saturday now, and the headache has gone away, but I&#8217;m still stupidly tired, despite copious quantities of sleep and a day spent at home doing&#8230; very little.

Actually, I got a bit done. I setup the &#8216;net connection from which I now type, which was interesting, and involved shuffling of my USB disk up and down stairs in order to automagically get the BigPond Cable login client onto my laptop &#8212; you&#8217;d think they could use some kind of uber proxy to direct unauthenticated users to a download page to let them grab the login client, but evidently not &#8212; anyway, that was fairly uneventful (although deciphering someone&#8217;s handwriting in order to get the password was a little&#8230; interesting). I&#8217;m kind of wondering why there isn&#8217;t just a router setup here, given that they&#8217;ve got a 12 or 16U cabinet with a patch panel, switch, and cable modem in it&#8230; but hey, it works, so I&#8217;m not complaining.

I also struggled to setup a network laser printer using IPX/SPX, which was&#8230; interesting, to say the least. At last I stumbled upon a nice application from HP which basically autodetects everything on your network for you, and sets it all up, which was nice of it! So now I have a snappy Telstra link, and a laser printer (which lives downstairs, meaning that I&#8217;ll probably be a little more restrained in my paper/printing usage &#8212; defininitely a GOOD thing!) which is snazzy.

Ummm&#8230; yes. So that was yesterday in a nutshell. I also put together a couple of quotes, and read Les Mis&#233;rables for a bit, and slept a bit more. Then spent too long on the phone, watched the first half-hour of Notting Hill (the movie goes downhill from there, I think!), and read, before once again falling asleep. Lots of sleep was had.

I have an assessment of sorts due Monday, but I can sort of negotiate that one back to Tuesday of next week, on account of being notified somewhat late, if I so desire. Which I think I do. So I will.
