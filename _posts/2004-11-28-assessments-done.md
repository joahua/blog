I just fired off my last assessment to the HP LaserJet 2100 downstairs. It&#8217;s the first assessment I&#8217;ve written&#8230; for a long, long time, that&#8217;s under 1000 words. Yes, it&#8217;s for ITF, the least academically taxing of *all* my subjects, Business Studies included. Sigh.

That&#8217;s what happens when something is marked as &#8220;Competent/Not Competent&#8221;. The notification informed me I was supposed to get the whole stupid thing bound at Kinko&#8217;s,

> &#8230; so that it actually looks like an installation manual.

Oh, it&#8217;s supposed to actually look like an installation manual, hey? I&#8217;ll pass the document through Babelfish a few dozen times, and then the language will closer resemble a &#8220;real&#8221; installation manual. Grrrr.

Needless to say, I grabbed my favorite stapler and jumped on it for a while. It&#8217;s not &#8220;professionally bound&#8221;, sorry. That&#8217;s what you get when there aren&#8217;t actually explicit assessment criteria outlined &#8212; students who don&#8217;t really care what they hand in, because showing they &#8220;know stuff&#8221; is enough to get graded as &#8220;competent&#8221;. That was worth 20% of my internal assessment for the year, just for the record.
