Assuming they do something about a PR department in this take-over/merger/whatever it&#8217;s being called, I think CCA has every chance of success. Well, whatever. I have no idea, to be perfectly honest. But blatant typos in press releases really *get* to me; I&#8217;ve just read three SPC Ardmona media releases, all of which featured errors a simple proofing by any literate person would have resolved.

Up with professionalism and copy-checking&#8230;
