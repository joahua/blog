If you&#8217;re running Windows or MacOS, and &#8220;*do*&#8221; screensavers (or even if you don&#8217;t, but would consider it for a worthy cause), go check out [Make LOVE not SPAM][1], a product of Lycos.

It&#8217;s a Denial of Service attack turned sideways &#8212; the screen saver will send requests for between three and four MB of data a day from sites on spam blacklists, etc., in order to make their bandwidth costs billow out of control, ultimately making spamming far more expensive than previously thought.

I love the idea, and have downloaded it here. Do it!
