I ended up calling my mobile service provider on the way home this afternoon (that&#8217;d be [Orange][1], for those who didn&#8217;t guess from the title of this post), in an attempt to find out just what the heck was going on with various things, specifically text messages. Yeouch.

I&#8217;ve been getting messages up to a day late for probably around a month now, which is kind of&#8230; irritating, to say the least. It does possibly keep my expenditure down (SMS is useless for rapid reply messaging a lot of the time), except for where I actually *need* it to communicate, and can&#8217;t &#8212; winding up making phone calls, instead. Having said that, it&#8217;ll occasionally work perfectly for a volley of ten or so, then just stop&#8230; and any remaining messages won&#8217;t arrive until the following morning, when I get into Sydney&#8217;s CBD and hit one of those cells (I presume that&#8217;s what it must be, because my timing is often quite different, yet the geographical place of arrival is often much the same).

[Graaaagh!!!][2]

The guy I spoke to was most helpful, but managed to tell me absolutely nothing, other than that there was a recognised network fault for SMS and some kind of other electronic mail services, which was being looked into (yet had no ETA). The disclosure made me happy, if nothing else&#8230; at least now I knew I could jump up and down and say how much their network sucked and feel justified, as opposed to if they denied it &#8212; I&#8217;d be left uncertain if it were just my phone or their network!

Ah, the joys of ranting.

Orange. Fair, but their network is crap.
