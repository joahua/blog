I got an email from a (to remain anonymous) wholesaler today advertising volume (and not-so-volume) pricing of 17&#8243; LCD screens, and was slightly shocked at how cheap they had become. I&#8217;ve been watching the prices fall in recent times along with everyone else, of course, but hadn&#8217;t bothered to check what the volume pricing was doing, and recently had fallen behind even on off-the-shelf (&#8220;retail&#8221;) pricing.

Enough ranting about not much: The single-unit price is now $295 ex. GST (Australian dollars, of course), with volume discounts kicking in at 20+ offering savings of $5 per unit. Is this reflecting increased LCD production? I&#8217;d imagine so&#8230; given that this is *very* rapidly approaching the price of similarly sized CRT models.

At this stage, I&#8217;m predicting the price difference between the two technologies will become negligible sometime mid-2005, production capacity permitting. Exciting stuff!
