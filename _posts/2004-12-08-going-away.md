This post has been written in advance, and my [blogging software][1] will automatically release it some time on Wednesday, at which stage I&#8217;ll probably be in a car headed North.

I&#8217;m disappearing for a few days with friends, so&#8230; don&#8217;t expect replies to email, or anything like that! Having said that, the contact form and everything else (comment posting included!) still works, and I&#8217;ll be reachable on my mobile, so don&#8217;t let my absence stop you from communicating with me in whatever way.

It&#8217;s Monday evening as I write this, but a school event at Town Hall will consume tomorrow from around 11 in the morning until sometime close to midnight, and I&#8217;m predicting a lack of motivation to turn on the laptop when I get home to make a post! So, farewell, for a few days!
