Grrrrrrrrr! The tax office here in Australia is realllly annoying me right about now. Apparently, foreign Proof of Identity is more reliable than an Australian equivalent &#8212; my Australian passport only counts as secondary ID (&#8220;Category B&#8221;, in ridiculous ATO parlance), whilst an identical overseas document is apparently primary! Hiss.

What&#8217;s even worse is that they require a permanent (as in fixed, as in NOT my current situation) place of residence for their records &#8212; the Postal address can be anything, but the home address must be an actual address, not a P.O. Box or anything like that. Which makes things difficult for nomads like me. Oh, right up until I called them, and asked what the deal was; apparently, there just needs to be *some* fixed address in that field&#8230; who cares if it isn&#8217;t mine?! The person I spoke to (who spoke English fluently, but with a rather illegible accent) advised I use the address of a parent or girlfriend or grandparent or employer or something &#8212; it kind of makes you wonder what the hell the point is in the first place. Surely, a *fixed* address, as opposed to a *mailing* address, is designed to allow them to come and beat down your door and arrest you for tax evasion if neccessary! Sigh.

Okay, rant over.
