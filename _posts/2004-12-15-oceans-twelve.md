A few days back, Stuart posted a brief entry on [Ocean&#8217;s Twelve][1], basically saying it&#8217;s the best thing since <del>sliced bread</del> Ocean&#8217;s Eleven, in terms of&#8230; most things. Anyway, I kind of believed him, and loved the original, so Tori and I went to see it some time today (my choice, for which &#8212; so I am told &#8212; I am now being held responsible); it wasn&#8217;t great.

Not straight out crap, just not great. It lacked any real concise and rapid plot development, instead being pulled together as one big twist machine which was seemingly poorly resolved and unified at the end point in the same way that the first movie so eloquently managed. The production side of things seemed a little lacklustre, too; they&#8217;ve gone for a decidedly boring type face for all on-screen text (primarily Arial!), and either their camera crew sucked, or they used only one take for the whole movie &#8212; it alternates between shaky and repetitive in terms of shots used, with an occasional cool one (which, statistically, probably had to happen) thrown in for good measure.

It might be worth seeing, but only once. Tori said that it&#8217;d probably make more sense if it were seen a few more times, but that&#8217;d mean having to sit through it again &#8212; the movie really wasn&#8217;t all that interesting!

<small>Full Disclosure: It was an early-afternoon session, and we hadn&#8217;t yet eaten lunch. This may have affected perceptions of the movie, attention spans, and responses to the constant eating of characters throughout the <em>entire planning process (!)</em>: serving only to induce further hunger and distract a little more from the plot! Having said all that, go see it, if only once&#8230; just eat beforehand or buy overpriced popcorn&#8230;</small>
