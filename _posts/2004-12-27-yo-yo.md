No broken strings. I&#8217;m here, but am just about to disappear again until post-NYE. Which is kind of lame, seeing NYE in Sydney or at least with friends beats NYE anywhere else with family, but you get that. Hope everyone&#8217;s been having a great Christmas and the like, and I&#8217;ll try to break the string and stick around some time in the not-too-distant future.

<small>p.s. We&#8217;ve bought a house, which, for all interested/caring, can be seen on the <a href="http://www.domain.com.au/Public/PropertyDetails.aspx?adid=2004664431">Domain website</a>. The listed price isn&#8217;t what we paid, but it&#8217;s fairly close. Yeah, it&#8217;s really really big. It&#8217;s also really really glassy. I&#8217;ll post some more/better pics when we actually move in, which is scheduled to be sometime in late January (around Australia Day &#8212; that&#8217;s January 26).</small>
