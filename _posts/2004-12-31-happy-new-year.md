I&#8217;m not going to be in Sydney until January 6 or thereabouts, but I hope everyone enjoys their various NYE celebrations and stays safe, etc. I&#8217;ll be in Canberra as of tonight, without any foreseen &#8216;net access &#8212; I will, however, have my mobile with me (the number is on my [Contact page][1], right column), should anyone urgently wish to get in touch&#8230; yeah, right ;)

Happy New Year!
