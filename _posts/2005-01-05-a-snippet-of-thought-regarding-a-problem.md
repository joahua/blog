[Scanning][1] is dealt with. *Finis*. Problem resolved, utterly. Cross-platform happiness &#8212; [remote access][2], even! [Printing][3] likewise. What&#8217;s left? The biggest issue of all&#8230; possibly. Depends on what pretty GUI tools and the like exist, I suppose&#8230; learning [new systems][4] in small timeframes is never really fun, but the learning curve shouldn&#8217;t be too dangerous. A few thousand dollar dangerous. Paperweight dangerous. Hardly! The paperweight wouldn&#8217;t be heavy enough to hold down paper! Ah, [breadbox computing][5].

<small><em>If this post makes no sense whatsoever to you, good. That was my intention. It&#8217;d be no fun letting the cat out of the bag before I had lots of cute pictures of the cat to show you all&#8230; so there&#8217;s a wait, until I get all this up and running, then I can start my geek boasting. No, this post is mostly about links. Smart cookies will likely have a moderately good idea what&#8217;s cooking, if they think about it, but the project should still hold a degree of excitement (hey, I know exactly what&#8217;s going on, I&#8217;m as excited as anyone!). In the (at this point) highly unlikely event that the whole concept falls apart horrendously, that will likewise be communicated in the fullness of time, along with the original intended idea and proposed course of action. Having said that, I plan to spend at least part of tomorrow morning organising hardware&#8230;</em></small>
