Again. Promise I&#8217;m not about to scurry away. Damn it, believe me!

Anyway, to make up for the distinct lack of content this place has been suffering from (although the hits don&#8217;t suffer, thanks to search engines and previous relevant content regarding MP3 players, the set of A Doll&#8217;s House, and miscellaneous other things&#8230;), here&#8217;s a list of what I&#8217;ve been reading over the last week or two. If you can&#8217;t read the titles on the cover images, hold your mouse over and text will appear. Clicking images takes you to the relevant [Amazon.com][1] product page (great for reviews that I&#8217;m too lazy to type now&#8230;). I&#8217;ve got more to say on some of these books, but can&#8217;t be bothered typing right about now.
