The subject of this posting occurred today with Sam, Katy (whom I had not seen for faaaar too long!), Ben and Sam&#8217;s dog, [Tuffy][1] (he has his own email address and website!) in a park in some part of Sydney kind of near the Anzac Bridge, at which lots of photos were taken. And at which I was given a whiteboard (!!) as a late-Christmas/early-Birthday present! Wowowowowow! So we had some fun with that thing, too. In a park, no less.

In an attempt to redeem myself in the eyes of my overly neglected PhotoStack installation (it&#8217;s only because I haven&#8217;t got a scanner at the minute, I promise! I&#8217;ve got four rolls of film to scan as soon as I move into permanent accomodation again and get the HP thing back!), I&#8217;m not going to post all the images on the front page (goodness, it might even save some bandwidth!) &#8212; if you wish to peruse the whole lot, [the whole album is online.][2]

My favorites:

![Never trust a man who, left alone with a tea cosy, does not try it on his head.  Penned on a whiteboard, complete with lame half illustration - mine.][3]

![Sam and Ben hold their baby... err... Tuffy.  Cute photo!][4]

![Sam and Tuffy poking out tounges.][5]

![Mother Katy holds Tuffy.][6]

As always, if you can be bothered, my comments reside in the ALT text for all images in the gallery (some are more extensive than others), which can be seen (generally) by holding your mouse over the relevant thumbnail/image. This may not work in Internet Explorer, sorry folks. Get [Firefox][7] if you want a web browser that&#8217;s faster, more secure, and generally does stuff well!

*If anyone feels my alternate textual explanations of the images are insufficient (e.g. require contextual knowledge of a visual nature in order to understand comments made, etc.), please feel free to let me know and I&#8217;ll do something about it. The [contact][8] form is the best way to get in touch.*
