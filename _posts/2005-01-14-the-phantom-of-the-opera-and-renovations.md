I saw the movie *The Phantom of the Opera* today with Tori, which was kind of good&#8230; sort of&#8230; well, bits of it anyway. I haven&#8217;t seen the real thing though, so haven&#8217;t got much to compare the movie to &#8212; suffice to say it was fairly well produced, but the acting was varied.

Anyway, we were walking around after it and wound up going past the Town Hall arcade food court, which has had some interesting renovations over the last few weeks that I hadn&#8217;t noticed/known about &#8217;til just now. Take a look:

Cool, huh?
