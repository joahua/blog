<img src="/blog/wp-content/2005/01/operahouse.jpg" alt="Sails of the Sydney Opera House illuminated at night." style="float:right;padding:5px;" />Tori and I saw [Cos&#236; fan tutti][1] by Mozart at the [Sydney Opera House][2] (Opera Theatre) tonight, which was great! The production was very cleverly produced in a surprisingly contemporary style, without diluting any of the original humour. Notably, actors stage directions in one scene are derived from an apparently innocuous simile likening the &#8220;Albanian&#8221; lovers to (what I think were) moths (or something like that) &#8212; they then proceed to move about the stage in a moth-like manner, dancing around the two sisters for much of the rest of the opera!

Scene changes were managed *very* cleverly (although slightly inconsistently with the rest of the production), as stage hands dressed as courtiers appear at the direction of one of the principals (perhaps by a hand clap, or other gesture) and rearrange the set accordingly. I say &#8220;inconsistently&#8221; because (and this was Tori&#8217;s observation) most of the other characters weren&#8217;t dressed in period costume! Still, it was transparent and inobtrusive: very well executed.

As for the actors (what exactly do you call them in opera? Are they still actors? Or singers? Is it safer just to stick with artists/performers?!) themselves, they were enthusiastic, clear, and apparently having a great time on stage (which, of course, rubs off on the audience &#8212; especially good in a comedy). Brilliant, we had a great time.
