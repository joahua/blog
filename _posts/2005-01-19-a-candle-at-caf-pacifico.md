<p>Last night my birthday was pre-emptively celebrated with the family (it was the 18<sup>th</sup>, my birthday is January 20 &#8212; siblings were going to stay with grandparents from this afternoon for a few days, so we celebrated it early) at <a href="http://www.cafepacifico.com.au/">Caf&#233; Pacifico</a> in East Sydney/Darlinghurst.  Food was great, and they had a hammock where normal places would have bar stools&#8230;</p>

<p>And I kind of randomly took a picture of a candle with the macro feature on my camera, which came out nicely:</p>
