I sort of kept forgetting to post this, or somehow waiting until it was more relevant (it didn&#8217;t get any more relevant the more I waited, I don&#8217;t think), but that&#8217;s stupid so here goes.

We&#8217;re settling next Monday (that&#8217;d be the 24th), and moving in on Monday the 31<sup>st</sup>&#8230; so, week after next, I&#8217;ll be in a new house. Incidentally, we&#8217;re also getting cable &#8220;installed&#8221; on the day we move (go figure&#8230; I can see the cable poking out of the wall, but it&#8217;s not *installed* unless some Telstra dude comes and plugs in a cable modem for me and says &#8220;It works now.&#8221;), and a bunch of new IT gear will arrive sometime next week (pre-moving in) to be built ready for installation pretty much as soon as we move in (assuming all goes well, and I can find some free time next week between trying to frantically get ready for school and doing non-academic-related work)

In other news, I&#8217;m finally [getting the Acoustic Research AR-14 speakers][1] when we move in, and they&#8217;ll hopefully arrive sometime early next week (Monday or Tuesday, I hope&#8230; otherwise it&#8217;ll be a while later) &#8212; I have music from the time we move in!

Oh, yeah, and I&#8217;m going to [IKEA][2] and buying lots of pillows, because I&#8217;m getting a fold-out sofa bed thing, and they&#8217;re no fun without lots of pillows (and IKEA has cheap pillows!)&#8230; I have one small dilemma, though &#8212; a few big pillows, or lots of little ones?
