This afternoon we got three copies of XP Professional for a ridiculous $85 each (after cashback which hasn&#8217;t quite happened yet&#8230; so, $125 each &#8212; $40 cashback). I love academic pricing. The computer I write this on is getting it installed probably some time tomorrow, a new system (well, new to me, recently acquired &#8212; it&#8217;s a Pentium 3) gets it sometime in the next week, and another Pentium 3 system will have it installed after we move in properly and I put a new 80GB hard drive in it (one of three which is coming in sometime this week, probably Tuesday-ish).

Exciting times!
