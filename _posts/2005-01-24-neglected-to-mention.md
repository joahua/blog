&#8230; that my parents got me a digital camera for the birthday a few days back. It&#8217;s a [Pentax Optio S40][1], has a 4MP sensor, 3x optical zoom (and some digital which I&#8217;ve of course disabled), a flash, 11MB inbuilt memory (I presume THAT means that there&#8217;s 16MB, 5MB of which is software stuff) and another 256MB SD card which we bought.

Every photo posted here from [The Lazy Kings][2] til now has been taken with that camera&#8230; yeah, I was using it before my birthday, bad me :P

I maintain that the other Pentax (SP 500 film SLR) takes better pictures, especially at night, but it&#8217;s just so much more expensive to use all the time! Having said that, I&#8217;m not going to let it sink into a cupboard and disappear: It&#8217;ll be on hand whenever i&#8217;m *planning* to take (good) photos, whilst the new Pentax will be for general happy snaps and the like.

Qualms with the camera thus far? It didn&#8217;t come with a rechargable battery. $90 later, and I&#8217;ve got a Samsung charger with killer battery life, so that&#8217;s no longer a problem &#8212; but it&#8217;s an expense that should be noted prior to purchase. Other than that, I haven&#8217;t figured out how to manually adjust exposure, so if you&#8217;re taking photos at night without a flash (scenic shots, etc.) then it&#8217;s not a great idea. Having said that, the massssssssiiiiveee exposure in &#8220;Night&#8221; mode does do some cool blurry things to photos&#8230;

The exposure time (according to the <acronym title="Exchangeable Image File">EXIF</acronym> data) on the Harbour Bridge image is 4 seconds, and 1 second on the first shot (Coogee) &#8212; but it felt like lots more, because it was really windy standing on the head. (No, not standing on *my* head&#8230; that would be talent!)
