How exactly are steaks fed?

Tori replied &#8220;Hey! I feed my steaks! Don&#8217;t you? Otherwise it&#8217;d be like&#8230; Steak abuse! You can&#8217;t let the poor things starve! Shame on you!!!&#8221;

Somebody had better call the <acronym title="Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Steaks">RSPCS</acronym> and report me, I suppose&#8230;
