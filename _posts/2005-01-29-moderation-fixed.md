Those who have tried commenting recently probably would have noticed their comments weren&#8217;t showing up for a while &#8212; this was as a result of my filters having a common term in them which essentially forced me to moderate everything manually. The list of banned terms is quite extensive, so it took me a while to find exactly what I&#8217;d done wrong and correct it; long story short, you can now comment and mostly expect your comment to pop up straight away (unless of couse you&#8217;re talking about your wonderful job at a casino where you get to play poker whilst selling viagra and cialis and watching free porn, in which case probably not).

Sorry for any inconvenience or confusion this may have caused recently &#8211; I&#8217;ve added a note above the comment posting area notifying people that moderation is in force and as such their comments may not appear straight away. If you have any further troubles, feel free to use the [contact form][1] (which, incidentally, also had problems with the &#8220;Confirm&#8221; page markup until around midnight &#8212; thanks [Steve][2] for pointing that out &#8212; I was still getting all messages sent via it, fortunately).
