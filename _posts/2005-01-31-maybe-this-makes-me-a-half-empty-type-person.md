&#8230; but I think that the fact that it has taken me longer to transfer a few ISOs from my laptop (10Mbit NIC) to another desktop than it did to download them from Telstra initially is kind of sad. Unfortunately, I had no other option, as I need to get the ISOs for my new server, and the laptop is the only computer with the BigPond client installed on it&#8230;

Ah well, under an hour for 1.2GB of files isn&#8217;t too bad ;) \*chuckles at ADSL people who are awed by non-Telstra DSLAMs that do 2Mbit/s\*
