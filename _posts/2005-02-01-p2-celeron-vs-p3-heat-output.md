Anyone know what the difference (if any) is for Pentium 2 Celerons vs. Pentium 3 FC-PGA 370 processors? I&#8217;ve got a Gateway system here with a P2-400 in it which I just gutted and am hoping to put a P3-866 into it (albeit probably at a lower than hoped clock speed &#8212; it&#8217;ll probably work out to 650MHz max due to the FSB being locked at 100MHz &#8212; purely speculation, but that&#8217;s the way brand name machines like this go), ideally with the same heatsink as was used on the Celeron. The case has one fan which is intelligent (heat-switched) which does the system and the power supply, and I&#8217;ve discovered (after literally RIPPING the processor out of its socket, because the heatsink was glued to the processor and I couldn&#8217;t get to the lever with the heatsink there) that there&#8217;s no auxillary fan power socket on the motherboard &#8212; so I&#8217;ll have fun using the stock intel cooler with the Pentium 3!

Yeah, so, if anyone knows rough heat output specs for those two it&#8217;d be great if you could post! I&#8217;m getting some more thermal goop tonight, but I still need to figure out how to work the fans&#8230; I think I&#8217;m just going to end up doing a dodgy direct-to-12V molex job with a paperclip in the worst case!
