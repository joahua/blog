Lack of posting is bad, so sorry &#8212; time has escaped me for much of the last few days! I&#8217;ve now got a network which is looking a little less sick, the speakers which have been previously alluded to, and a JVC receiver/amp which is driving them. And too little sleep, and too much pending work! :P Ah well, comes with moving house or something&#8230;

just wanted to prove I still existed. (Nope, no photos&#8230; I can&#8217;t find the camera at the minute either!)
