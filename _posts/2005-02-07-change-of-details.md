If you haven&#8217;t already figured out the new address from previous postings, or couldn&#8217;t be bothered to click a link through to the &#8220;Sold&#8221; page to find out where it was, I&#8217;m posting new details now. Additionally, there are co-ordinates posted on my [Contact][1] page should you wish to send ICBM&#8217;s this way&#8230;

12 Magill Street  
RANDWICK 2031  
NSW, Australia

The fixed telephone number has also changed; if you need it, send me an email or text (SMS) me (mobile number is posted on contact page), and I&#8217;ll give it to you. Yeah, I actually would rather the whole world didn&#8217;t know that one, really.

My <josh@ii.net> address is **no longer used, finally**. Yes, I did just post a mailto link. Hopefully anyone else who trys to use it in the future will initially login, get too much spam in the first hour, and decide that was a stupid, stupid idea and go for a more obscure address. And just for the record, most of the spam was attained by previous owners (and other people who were utterly *convinced* that it was their email address, despite it being mine and mine alone for probably over a year. Yes, Josh Marks of South Australia, I&#8217;m looking at you.), not me, so don&#8217;t go accusing me of being irresponsible with the email address to the extent that it became widely circulated! As it is, I was probably asking for it by having a commonname@isp.tld address, but still, irresponsible usage certainly played a part in the spam received.

To contact me electronically, use the contact form and I&#8217;ll email you back (and you can reply to that address), or simply send email to whatever address you would like to use at this domain &#8212; that is to say, a catch-all. I know that was worded terribly obscurely, but I&#8217;m paranoid about such things &#8212; if you need to send me an email, the [contact form][1] does just that.
