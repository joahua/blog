Ben&#8217;s [just posted about it][1], so I figure the leadership team are okay with it being released to the world &#8212; Our school leadership team of 2005 are taking a metaphor to extremes, with our very own Naked Chef, amongst other things.

It&#8217;s available for download from Ben&#8217;s site, but for faster downloads grab it from [this mirror][2] today.

~16.5MB, WMV only.

*SACS students, Andrew Garrett will be fulfilling his promise of singing in about two weeks time!*
