Kristen&#8217;s somewhat irate about the incessant misuse of the abbreviation &#8220;LOL&#8221; in electronic communication (well&#8230; supposedly only electronic communication&#8230; yeah, I&#8217;ve used it IRL occasionally&#8230; enough about *that*!), so she went and posted all about [the potential evil of lol][1]. Compulsory reading if you&#8217;re a regular &#8220;LOL&#8221; user/abuser!
