It&#8217;s been two weeks today since we moved into the new house. Just thought I&#8217;d say that. No, the IT situation isn&#8217;t loads better, but I&#8217;m working on it. Between assessments and other stuff.

If this stupid HP thing would play nice with hpoj and FreeBSD, I&#8217;d be sweet (well, you know, still gotta learn OpenLDAP and the rest of it, but sweet*er*), but of course *that&#8217;s* not likely to happen in a hurry. I&#8217;ve decided if it still isn&#8217;t working by this weekend I&#8217;m going to revert to trying with Parallel cables. Tis a sad day indeed.

In other news, the Commander system has been working okay, but there are more than a handful of moments of frustration when trying to get other devices to play nice on the system (e.g. not sanctioned HX308 phones), so for the moment we&#8217;ve installed a cordless handset in parallel to the Commander system (that is, not on a system port) &#8212; that means it&#8217;s out of reach of the rest of the PBX, but at least it can make phone calls (which is good, seeing it&#8217;s cordless and the HX308 things all aren&#8217;t). Some issues with line noise, but then the cordless thing is currently connected by a socket hanging out of a wall connected in about 30 seconds by yours truely. Oh, and if you&#8217;re from Austel, I just made all that up.
