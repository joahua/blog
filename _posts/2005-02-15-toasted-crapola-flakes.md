![1940's or 50's design Kellogg's corn flakes box, altered to read  &#8220;Crapola Flakes &#8221;][1]

It&#8217;d been discussed before, so I made this and posted here&#8230; just because I could. Thoughts, comments, feedback all welcome. I love this period of design! Can&#8217;t decide if the original of this design was 40&#8242;s or 50&#8242;s, though. Oh, yeah, the original read &#8220;Toasted Corn Flakes&#8221; just for the record!!
