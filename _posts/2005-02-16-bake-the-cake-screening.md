It finally happened today &#8212; the public screening of the Bake the Cake video released here a few days ago, shot on January 24<sup>th</sup>, and edited the day after. It was most exciting to finally see an audience&#8217;s response to it!

Now, apparently, the entire school has seen it, and <acronym title="St. Andrew's Cathedral School">SACS</acronym> students can expect to be subjected to Andrew&#8217;s singing in assembly at some point in the not-too-distant future&#8230; singing *what* exactly remains to be determined, although some have proposed the composition of a Bake the Cake *song*(!) to the tune of some well known-ish piece of music, just so everyone recognises it and can laugh if things go wrong!

A series of still images from the shoot are included on the right side (above this post if you&#8217;re not doing the whole CSS thing &#8212; and if you aren&#8217;t using a visual UA then it doesn&#8217;t matter much at all!) for your enjoyment (or something!) &#8212; most of the photos were taken by [Ben][1] using my digital Pentax Optio S40. Look at them. Be entertained. Especially by the last one. And if you haven&#8217;t yet seen the video, hurry up and [download it before it goes!][2] (WMV format, 16.5MB)
