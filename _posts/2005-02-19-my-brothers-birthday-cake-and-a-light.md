I don&#8217;t usually post about birthdays, simply because that means people will be disappointed if I forget/don&#8217;t post for them&#8230; but my brother Lachlan had a really cool cake, so I&#8217;m posting a picture of that to make you all hungry!

And I also bought a lamp for my room today which is just *awesome* (was only $6, too!), so here&#8217;s a photo of that&#8230;

Isn&#8217;t it cool?
