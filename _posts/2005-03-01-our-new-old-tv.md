We&#8217;ve finally bought a TV capable of having RCA cables plugged directly into it! Sure, it&#8217;s second hand, conventional (i.e. not flat) CRT and a Sanyo, but it&#8217;s 51cm and means we don&#8217;t need to use a 19&#8243; BenQ LCD bizarrely wired directly to our DVD player which has a VGA output (nearly exactly half the LCD&#8217;s native resolution, which is handy, but it&#8217;s a pain to lug from the office to the living room every time we wanna watch a DVD!).

So that&#8217;s exciting. I&#8217;d post pictures, but just imagine any generic curvy CRT TV and you&#8217;ve got the right idea. ;) It wasn&#8217;t really worth the time it&#8217;d take to find the camera, take a photo, come upstairs, upload photo, resize photo, login and upload via FTP, and then figure out the path to the file for inclusion in this post!

It also has wonderful wonderful mono sound, but that&#8217;s okay, because we&#8217;ve got a nice Sony system hooked up for that&#8230; at least the audio side of things is pretty good quality, even if the vision is functional but far from excellent (Infinitely better than the 20-or-30-something year old set we used to use as the main TV, though!)&#8230;

***Later:*** As a direct result of the wonders of procrastination, I ventured downstairs with a camera and took a photo of a perfectly boring TV.
