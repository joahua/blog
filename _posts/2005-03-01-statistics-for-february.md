It&#8217;s a tad down from last month in everything except unique visitors, which means I just haven&#8217;t been creating enough new content and have been dependent on search engine traffic for hits from irregular visitors.

Yes, I should get back to posting real content, but I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s not too likely, between school (3 weeks to half yearlies! I know we&#8217;re not halfway through the year, but the final year of schooling is odd here in Australia!) and a production next week which is likely to consume all waking hours! I&#8217;ll hopefully get a chance to post regular or semi-regular photos, at least, but maybe not.
