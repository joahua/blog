It was a great night, and there&#8217;s a load of rather blurry photographs which I just rotated, resized, uploaded and painstakingly added ALT text for in my [Photography][1] section. Go [take a look!][2]

The last photo isn&#8217;t from the carnival &#8211; it&#8217;s a picture of a Smart car bearing the numberplate &#8220;Petit&#8221; (sic)&#8230; Ben and I both thought it was funny, but unfortunately he was driving and I&#8217;m incapable of taking an un-blurry photo with my digital, hence the crappiness.
