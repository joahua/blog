Not *new* photos, just part of the massive film backlog that needed to be scanned and published online. Just because. Heh, and my brother scanned about 80 photos for me because he wanted one of them&#8230; I said he could have a scenic photo or three (that&#8217;s what he was looking for&#8230; no idea why) if he scanned the lot (well, sort of&#8230; he kind of volunteered as well), and he did! Yay!

I still got the task of cropping and colour correcting (transport faults on the camera when I set the shutter speed too low&#8230; it&#8217;ll go to 1000<sup>th</sup> of a second, but it&#8217;s not *labelled* as such, and only sometimes works properly&#8230; so the colour banding on some images is as a result of that. I&#8217;m not using that setting in the future!) the photos, but shrug.

So the latest ones are from December last year, taken in Tea Gardens, whilst on a holiday with Ben, Tori and Nicolin. No, there is no reason for Snoopy being there, except for my wanting to finish the film before I went away again&#8230; I didn&#8217;t finish the film in time. More photos to come are from the cruise, but not until I get time to crop them all (they&#8217;re scanned 3 to a plate).
