Has anyone else who does the whole design thing ever come up with something they&#8217;re convinced is great, then been told that it&#8217;s not quite what the client was looking for and having to go back to designing something that just doesn&#8217;t feel as right, but is closer to the client&#8217;s desire?

That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened to me recently&#8230; who remembers the Windows High Contrast themes? It&#8217;s looking something like that&#8230; red, black and white, coming from the previous design of far subtler blues and greens. Apparently it&#8217;s &#8220;youthful&#8221;, although I think it&#8217;s a tad too aggressive, personally! My current task? Turn the German flag into a website.

&#8230; it&#8217;ll get done, and possibly even look good, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I agree with it! Who else has felt that what a client is asking for in terms of design just feels *wrong*, even if their suggestion *could* be made to work just fine?
