I filled up my memory card (256MB) on the digital camera for the first time thus far (without a change of batteries, no less!), taking around 130 pictures. Most of them sucked.

Having said that, the dress rehearsal itself (the first rehearsal in the venue, as well as the first dress rehearsal) was pretty amazingly ready, even if technical is still pulling together (we&#8217;ll get there). I&#8217;ve picked out a photo or three just because I felt like sticking up pretty pictures before the school itself had a chance to, so here goes:

![A view from the back of the Cathedral looking towards a parted chorus framing a singer who stands in the centre of the stage.][1]

![Jesus is crucified][2]

![Jesus is carried from the stage by six people, surrounded by chorus.][3]

If you&#8217;ve been in the Cathedral before, and are coming to the show, don&#8217;t expect it to be the same as you last remembered it&#8230;
