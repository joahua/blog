The following is a reply to the message quoted inline below, posted on my contact form, with a return email address clearly not likely to be used for anything else but the purpose of ensuring anonymity in further correspondence. As stated, with something this serious I don&#8217;t think anonymity has its place, and I&#8217;m disregarding the message unless further contact is made.

> I&#8217;m aware that he uses another name on occasion (he&#8217;s answered the phone using the other name &#8212; which I don&#8217;t recall &#8212; and I&#8217;ve also seen it on quotes and invoices, etc.), although whether that&#8217;s his &#8220;real&#8221; name and William is not I didn&#8217;t know. Having said that, is it of consequence? Yes, he is still working at the school. I&#8217;m not particularly interested in further contact unless you come out from the shroud of anonymity you currently hide behind, simply for the reason that any information you could provide I simply would not trust unless I knew who you were. When I published that letter, there was no degree of anonymity in its form, and it was hosted on a website where my name, address, and telephone number are all displayed prominently on the contact page. Unless you wish to meet similar standards of disclosure, please refrain from future correspondence on this matter.

I have got some very interesting information about &#8216;William&#8217; McCormack that I would like to share with you. Did you know that William is in fact not his real name? It gets a lot better than this&#8230;
