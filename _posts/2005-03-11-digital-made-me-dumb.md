The last two nights I&#8217;ve used my Pentax SP500 (film SLR) camera, and I&#8217;m more than a tad annoyed at myself. Less so tonight than yesterday, but there we go &#8212; either way, it&#8217;s not good. I hadn&#8217;t really used the film camera since about January this year (I know, it&#8217;s appalling; more as a result of time than desire, however, as I haven&#8217;t had many planned opportunities for *good* photography sessions), so this was the first time I&#8217;d really used it since getting the digital toy (because, really, despite the optical zoom, that&#8217;s all it is).

It&#8217;s created three major problems, in terms of my photography skills. Firstly, I&#8217;m snap-happy. It&#8217;s ridiculous (ridiculously *expensive*!). Last night I went through a roll of 35mm film in one performance (didn&#8217;t cover the whole show, either), and tonight, when I was trying to cover the bit I missed, I went through *another* roll in under 15 minutes. Yeeaaahhhh.

That&#8217;s not so much a technical issue as a stylistic one, however. Far more importantly, I quite literally forgot that adjustable F-stop rings existed. Needless to say, when I remembered, I kicked myself rather hard. Stupidity++.

I&#8217;d also forgotten to use the spot meter until about halfway through the night (and, honestly, it&#8217;s pretty useful to have! Complain all you want about how they&#8217;re inaccurate and don&#8217;t truely measure what they&#8217;re seeing, but it&#8217;s a great reference point &#8212; I&#8217;m not saying follow them blindly, but they certainly help), which probably resulted in a whole number of too-dark photos (or too-unneccesarily-blurry photos &#8212; the shutter was set to quarter second exposure for most of the night!)

Speaking of enormous exposures, I&#8217;m really loving having a CHUNKY camera to hold again. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love my tiny Optio (it fits in my pocket perfectly), but not for night photography sans flash. It&#8217;s just too small to hold steadily, unless you&#8217;re braced against something incredibly solid, or you get lucky with the subject moving as your hand does (cool focused subject with blurred background &#8212; nothing to do with depth of field, just motion). The SP500, however&#8230; drool. I haven&#8217;t had time to get these two rolls put in for developing yet, but it just *feels* good to use. Ridiculously good. It&#8217;s like moving from a disposable camera, almost (a GOOD disposable camera, but still).

This is why when I got the digital I tried to convince myself I&#8217;d never use it for anything serious &#8212; because I fully recognise it&#8217;s a dinky little toy. It exists to be taken nearly everywhere, to capture anything, just for kicks. Like this police car, for example&#8230;
