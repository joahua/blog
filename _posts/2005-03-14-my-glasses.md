I picked them up from the local [OPSM][1] this afternoon&#8230; they&#8217;re weakest strength reading glasses (I&#8217;m very slightly long-sighted), and it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve ever worn them (e.g. had glasses). The main reason for getting glasses was because of massive headaches I get, which eye strain may or may not have something to do with. I think it would have been cheaper to buy a nice LCD screen and ditch this CRT monster, but the glasses help with reading on paper, too, so there we go!
