Apologies for what&#8217;s been a bumpy couple of days here, as [Michael&#8217;s][1] hosting begins the shift to a FreeBSD-based server (for shared hosting&#8230; his own website&#8217;s been running off it for some time now). <img src="/blog/wp-content/2005/03/rollercoaster.jpg" alt="Rollercoaster." style="float:left;margin:0.5em;" />

Just to make things perfectly clear, he&#8217;s hosting this website for free, and it&#8217;s absolutely incredible most of the time (especially considering it&#8217;s running off a consumer Internet connection!) &#8212; but it&#8217;s likely to have been a slightly sporadic time in terms of being able to access things, and in terms of things working properly&#8230; for example, the PhotoStack RSS feed and page itself was out the other day, which I&#8217;d have attributed to a lack of lib_xml and/or GD(2) support, but apparently this was just the fault of a [certain permissions accident][2]. Similarly, sendmail (or the equivalent being used) *was* out as a result of permissions &#8212; apparently it&#8217;s back up, but the contact form (which, incidentally, needs a recode) still isn&#8217;t working, and neither (so far as I can tell) is my moderation update emails.

For you, dear reader, this simply means that the contact form is temporarily out of action, and your comments may take slightly longer than usual to approve (yes, at this stage, all comments *are* being manually approved, to effectively combat spam. I&#8217;ll review the situation whenever I get around to switching to 1.5 &#8212; probably some time in the next two weeks).
