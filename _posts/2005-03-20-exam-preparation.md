Snippets of conversation from MSN.

Regarding Minesweeper:

> Ben: best time for expert is something like 183  
> Josh: i dont know if i&#8217;ve ever beat it, actually  
> Josh: hehe  
> Josh: well  
> Josh: im sure i have a few times  
> Josh: but i never pay any attention to how LONG  
> Josh: coz its always a distraction  
> Josh: not an extreme sport  
> Josh: &#8230;or something  
> Ben: hey minesweeper SO is a sport

Regarding Telstra&#8217;s crappy DNS:

> Ben: use iinets:P  
> Josh: yeah i was, but that was just as slow&#8230; something about something? i dont know, it still DOWNLOADS fast, just takes ages to RESOLVE anything :/  
> Ben: sucks to be you trying to resolve?  
> Josh: hehe, guess so :p  
> Josh: but that&#8217;s okay  
> Josh: because it&#8217;s the journey, not the resolution, which matters  
> Josh: ;)  
> Ben: so exactly how many hops is it between your modem and the telstra DNS? explain the language forms and features (in binary) used and how they effect the responder (your home computer) as it goes about its trip.

What has the Board of Studies done to us?
