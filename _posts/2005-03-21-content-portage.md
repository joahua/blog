I&#8217;m finally getting around to moving posts and miscellaneous other junk across from <a href="/mid04/" rel="nofollow">my old weblog</a>, powered by my own junky PHP thing, to this current WordPress installation. There are two reasons for this &#8212; firstly, I&#8217;d been meaning to do it for ages, but hadn&#8217;t been bothered to, and secondly, I&#8217;m soon upgrading this to WordPress 1.5 (so I can use my [own][1] [much][2] [talked][3] [about][4] [DashLite][5], amongst other things! ;) Yeah, I&#8217;m enjoying my 5 minutes of fame&#8230;), which means this is as good a time as any to do something about it.

Additionally, there&#8217;s just been a server overhaul, which puts everyone in the mood to play and generally break things as a side result of the creative process &#8212; oh, yeah, and I&#8217;m kinda sorta on holidays, between exams (well, you know, studying hard &#8212; but I need something to keep me sane!). Kudos to [Dale][6] for his help with porting the articles&#8230; working on the comments still, but it&#8217;ll get there (probably, assuming I don&#8217;t just give up in disgust!).

Something of a more creative nature to come, maybe, once the move to 1.5 happens&#8230; it makes that sort of thing easier.
