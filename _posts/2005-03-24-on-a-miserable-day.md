Two days ago was the most windy (and wet) day Sydney had seen for a while. Personally, I enjoy that kind of weather (except this house sounds like it&#8217;s going to blow over, but oh well), especially if you don&#8217;t need to go outside on that particular day.

Our dog had the right idea of what to do &#8212; I snapped a photo to share with the world:

![Dumbledore hiding in his basket type thing][1]

<small>A note to the perceptive: Yes, the edges of that photo have been desaturated. Shouldn&#8217;t be too blatant, though&#8230;</small>
