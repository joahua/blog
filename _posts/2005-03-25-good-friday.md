*From Mark 15, NIV translation*

**Jesus Before Pilate**

<sup id="en-NIV-24821">1</sup>Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate. 

<sup id="en-NIV-24822">2</sup>â€œAre you the king of the Jews?â€ asked Pilate.

â€œYes, it is as you say,â€ Jesus replied. 

<sup id="en-NIV-24823">3</sup>The chief priests accused him of many things. <sup id="en-NIV-24824">4</sup>So again Pilate asked him, â€œAren&#8217;t you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.â€

<sup id="en-NIV-24825">5</sup>But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.

<sup id="en-NIV-24826">6</sup>Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested. <sup id="en-NIV-24827">7</sup>A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising. <sup id="en-NIV-24828">8</sup>The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did. 

<sup id="en-NIV-24829">9</sup>â€œDo you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?â€ asked Pilate, <sup id="en-NIV-24830">10</sup>knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. <sup id="en-NIV-24831">11</sup>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead. 

<sup id="en-NIV-24832">12</sup>â€œWhat shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?â€ Pilate asked them.

<sup id="en-NIV-24833">13</sup>â€œCrucify him!â€ they shouted.

<sup id="en-NIV-24834">14</sup>â€œWhy? What crime has he committed?â€ asked Pilate.

But they shouted all the louder, â€œCrucify him!â€

<sup id="en-NIV-24835">15</sup>Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.

**The Soldiers Mock Jesus**

<sup id="en-NIV-24836">16</sup>The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers. <sup id="en-NIV-24837">17</sup>They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. <sup id="en-NIV-24838">18</sup>And they began to call out to him, â€œHail, king of the Jews!â€ <sup id="en-NIV-24839">19</sup>Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. <sup id="en-NIV-24840">20</sup>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.

**The Crucifixion**

<sup id="en-NIV-24841">21</sup>A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. <sup id="en-NIV-24842">22</sup>They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <sup id="en-NIV-24843">23</sup>Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. <sup id="en-NIV-24844">24</sup>And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.

<sup id="en-NIV-24845">25</sup>It was the third hour when they crucified him. <sup id="en-NIV-24846">26</sup>The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup id="en-NIV-24847">27</sup>They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left. <sup id="en-NIV-24848">29</sup>Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, â€œSo! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, <sup id="en-NIV-24849">30</sup>come down from the cross and save yourself!â€

<sup id="en-NIV-24850">31</sup>In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. â€œHe saved others,â€ they said, â€œbut he can&#8217;t save himself! <sup id="en-NIV-24851">32</sup>Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.â€ Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.

**The Death of Jesus**

<sup id="en-NIV-24852">33</sup>At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. <sup id="en-NIV-24853">34</sup>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, â€œEloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?â€â€“which means, â€œMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?â€

<sup id="en-NIV-24854">35</sup>When some of those standing near heard this, they said, â€œListen, he&#8217;s calling Elijah.â€ 

<sup id="en-NIV-24855">36</sup>One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. â€œNow leave him alone. Let&#8217;s see if Elijah comes to take him down,â€ he said.

<sup id="en-NIV-24856">37</sup>With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.

<sup id="en-NIV-24857">38</sup>The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. <sup id="en-NIV-24858">39</sup>And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, â€œSurely this man was the Son of God!â€
