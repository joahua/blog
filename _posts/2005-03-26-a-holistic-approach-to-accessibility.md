In light of the Digital Divide, what can the &#8220;web standards&#8221; community be doing to ensure most accessible practices are employed?

*   Understanding that the Digital Divide is as much about training and usability as it is about physical access and type of resources
*   Designing websites with this in mind, in terms of physical layout and usability for first-time users or users unfamiliar with technology: 
    *   *layout* of websites
    *   prominence of *navigation/logical structure*
    *   effective use of *iconography/pictures/glyphs* to communicate
    *   *content* avoids use of technical jargon, or adequately explains it (i.e. IT related, not other industry specific)

Lots more could be written about this, but I thought it best to simply put the idea out there, rather than write a lengthy post on it. I may explain this at greater length at some point, but the thought just hit me as I was writing a related but not web usability oriented essay, and the distraction was too great!
