I&#8217;ve got no idea why there are so many dog photos at the minute, but I just *have* to share this &#8212; our dog has decided to employ furniture as its own bunk bed of sorts. He was asleep, but by the time I ran to get the camera he&#8217;d been woken up, and looked towards the camera as he heard the zoom go&#8230;
