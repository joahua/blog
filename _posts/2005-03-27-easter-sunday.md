*From Mark 16, NIV translation*

**The Resurrection**

<sup>1</sup>When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus&#8217; body. <sup>2</sup>Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb <sup>3</sup>and they asked each other, &#8220;Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?&#8221;

<sup>4</sup>But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away. <sup>5</sup>As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.

<sup>6</sup>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be alarmed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. <sup>7</sup>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, &#8216;He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.&#8217; &#8220;
