We got motorised roller shutters installed today from&#8230; some company that does that thing. Basically [our back area][1] is a greenhouse (effectively), and gets stupidly hot&#8230; and we&#8217;re not quite in winter yet, but predictions run that it&#8217;ll also get stupidly cold at night with heat escaping through the glass.

So&#8230; it was an excuse for some pictures.

![Looking up, one shutter halfway, other closed][4]  
![View from outside, one open, one closed][5]  
![One shutter closing][6]  
![Both closed][7]

It also has a fun switch to play with&#8230;
