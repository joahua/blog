<p>Just thought I&#8217;d brag for a moment about how, with only one incoming link in the entire world, and no visible text on the webpage, a site achieved the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=simon+breakspear&#038;start=0&#038;start=0&#038;ie=utf-8&#038;oe=utf-8">number 1 Google match globally</a> in under 24 hours after adding the first link.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.simonbreakspear.com.au/"><img src="http://www.joahua.com/blog/wp-content/2005/04/sb.jpg" alt="Simon Breakspar" /></a></p>
<p>Make that two links.  The point stands, there&#8217;s not even any visible text on that page, and, had it been created with Fireworks or Photoshop or something that autosplices and makes a table, search engines still wouldn&#8217;t know about it.</p>
<p><em>Full disclosure: <a href="http://www.simonbreakspear.com.au/">www.simonbreakspear.com.au</a> is a website developed by <a href="http://www.base10solutions.com.au/">base10solutions</a>, for whom I work.  The holder page located there at present should only persist a while longer, until the full website launches.</em></p>
