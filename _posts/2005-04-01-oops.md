<img src="/blog/wp-content/2005/04/dashoops.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Google's results for DashLite" style="float:right;" />Just to continue the SEO train of thought, it seems I should have checked the name &#8220;DashLite&#8221; before launching a product with that name &#8212; someone else has already taken [DashLite.com][1], for a company which sells torches under the brand (a registered trademark, no less!) of &#8220;DASHLITE&#8221;.

A few days back, [my original DashLite post][2] was ranked first for that term&#8230; fortunately, it looks as though Google have either noticed, or Dashlite complained (but haven&#8217;t said anything to me&#8230; If anyone from Dashlite is reading this, please feel free to get in touch) and the index was resolved. Go figure!

Apologies to Conwave, Inc. for the error &#8212; to everyone else (and perhaps including them), here&#8217;s a demonstration of what accessible, semantic, keyword-driven design and content can do for you!
