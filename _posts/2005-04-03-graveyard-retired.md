Some more attentive regulars (who don&#8217;t just peruse this website by means of syndication) may have noticed the disappearance of a link in the top bar in the last several hours. This is because I&#8217;ve *finally* got all the old content into WordPress, with no small amount of assistance from [Michael][1], under a category called &#8220;[Before WordPress][2]&#8221; (this post is categorised similarly, and shall likely be the last ever entry into that category).

Practically, this means that that content is using semantically better markup, has better meta information for search engines, and is *internally* searchable, using the WordPress search function (it wasn&#8217;t before).

For most regulars, this probably doesn&#8217;t mean much, but the old articles attract the most search engine traffic, so this&#8217;ll be of benefit to people finding relevant content, at least, because the old script could be somewhat retarded in the way it was indexed, as there was no formal permalink structure, just a bunch of loose query strings, which search engines didn&#8217;t like.
