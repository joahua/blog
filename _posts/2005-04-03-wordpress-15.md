I&#8217;ve *finally* shifted this weblog across to the most excellent [WordPress][1] 1.5, which means I can now use my own [DashLite][2], as well as improved themes management (which I&#8217;ve unceremoniously trampled upon to keep this current behemoth working quickly), spam combatting features, and slightly-more-than-rudimentary content management capabilities.

<del>I was hoping to release a new theme with this upgrade, but whilst I&#8217;m keen on procrastinating, I&#8217;d really rather not fail my exams tomorrow and the subsequent day&#8230; maybe later this week.</del>

*Ten minutes later:* Stuff it. I&#8217;ve banged in the theme I was planning to base the new one on, coz it&#8217;s just so cool I couldn&#8217;t leave it a moment longer! Full credit, of course, to [Chris Lin][3]. I&#8217;ll be making bits and pieces different so it&#8217;s not just a stock theme, but I felt like a change and hadn&#8217;t had time to whip up something of my own, so this&#8217;ll do for the time being (plus it&#8217;s sexy!)
