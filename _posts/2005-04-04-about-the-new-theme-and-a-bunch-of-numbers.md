Okay, so maybe throwing a new theme up like that straight away wasn&#8217;t the greatest of ideas&#8230; but you&#8217;ve gotta admit it looks cool. I&#8217;ve just patched up the contact page (n.b. the address has changed, coz it&#8217;s now managed through WordPress Pages&#8230; I&#8217;ll figure out a way around this, and *both* the old form and the new themed one work, but for the time being the address is `<a href="/blog/contact/">/blog/contact/</a>` rather than the old `<a href="/contact/">/contact/</a>`), as well as a [few posts][1] that were being dodgy&#8230; especially with graphics, which&#8217;d been designed for a fixed-width site of 600px, as opposed to&#8230; whatever this is. I haven&#8217;t got time to go slashing at CSS just yet, but it&#8217;ll happen, unavoidably! (I&#8217;ve heard and completely agree with readability comments&#8230; that&#8217;ll be one of the first things to be fixed, because it&#8217;s a real problem&#8230;)

In other exciting news, I just cracked 1GB of transfers this year.. which doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, but I did around 470MB last month, and this month (albeit 4 days in) is looking to be similar in terms of transfers and hits if the trend continues. Last month there were 44,444 hits (isn&#8217;t that a cool number?) exactly, probably in no small way as a result of the moderately successful DashLite, which has got a ridiculous number of trackbacks or comments in the last 24 hours (well, I thought it was&#8230; shrug!), taking the total number of comments on that post to 15, probably the most comments on any single post on this site.

Now I&#8217;m gonna wander off cram for a Business exam I&#8217;ve got in a few hours, so I can pack it full of buzzwords and be awarded marks accordingly&#8230; \*sighs at folly of that subject\*
