For no particular reason, here are some photos from the last week of my life.

![A photo down an underground passage filled with people, with focus on the roof featuring graffiti. No focus on people who identify me as 'the freak holding the camera'.][1]

![My eye, shot in macro mode with a focal length of about 10mm][2]

![Macro shot over the bridge of a violin down the strings][3]
