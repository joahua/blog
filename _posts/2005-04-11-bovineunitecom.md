[<img src="/blog/wp-content/2005/04/bovineunite.jpg" alt="Bovine Unite propaganda" style="float:right;" />BOVINEUNITE.COM][1] &#8212; a pure Flash website devoted to &#8220;C-Day&#8221; and the revolt of the cows sick of being milked for all they&#8217;re worth by humans!

I wish you could use anchor references with Flash, because my personal favorite video in this site I can&#8217;t link directly to! If you can find the Bovine National Anthem (Under Cow News Network > Today Pastures. Tomorrow the World.), it&#8217;s worth a look&#8230; one of the funnier, remarkably well produced (if udderly unaccessible &#8212; sorry, couldn&#8217;t help myself) websites I&#8217;ve recently seen&#8230; and an excellent example of effective Flash Video usage!

There&#8217;s also some propaganda which&#8217;d be fun to stick up around the place if you&#8217;ve got access to a colour laser printer you&#8217;re not paying for!
