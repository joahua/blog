Ironically found on an <acronym title="Uninterruptible Power Supply">UPS</acronym>&#8230; but enough of the bad puns. Does anyone know what this connector is?

![A 20 amp power socket with three cores][1]

It&#8217;s marked as being 20 amp, but it&#8217;s only got three cores in a sort of quasi-3 phase connector (I think there&#8217;s a word/brand for that which I should know but don&#8217;t) which is missing two cores. The closest thing I&#8217;ve found is [a forum posting][2] (second post from bottom on page) which claims these are used for single-phase staging/event gear at least in the UK (they use the same voltages as Australia, I think), with 63A, 32A and 16A varieties available (connectors are physically different sizes, and coloured blue to mark them as single phase, as opposed to the conventionally red/orange 3 phase connectors). I assume that the Clipsal labelling of the socket as 20A simply refers to the maximum socket load rather than what the device behind the socket is happy driving&#8230; but maybe not.

Anyone seen these things before?
