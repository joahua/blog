<p><a href="http://www.aco.com.au/concerts/performances/2005/concert_3_2005">An awesome performance</a> by the <a href="http://www.aco.com.au/">ACO</a> at the <a href="http://www.cityrecitalhall.com/" title="WARNING: Frames and crappy Flash intro!">Angel Place City Recital Hall</a> last night, also on tonight and Saturday there and on Sunday at the Sydney Opera House.  Also featuring the photography of Bill Henson, in a moderately well produced but holistically insignificant simultaneous visual display to live and prerecorded music.</p>
<p>It was excellent.  Go see it if you can.</p>
<p>p.s. Angel Place is an awesome venue.</p>
