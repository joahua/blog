This afternoon I&#8217;ll be dropping off the map for a while due to a holiday to Victoria (although regrettably not *with*, because that would be rather nice), and no Internet access is anticipated.

I&#8217;ll probably be back by Friday the 22<sup>nd</sup>, but depending on&#8230; what people want to do&#8230; it could be as late as Sunday the 24<sup>th</sup>. Apologies if comment moderation takes stupid amounts of time &#8212; users who have already been able to post comments shouldn&#8217;t experience any problems, though. As always, the contact form works (I just won&#8217;t be reading it for a week), and I&#8217;ll have my mobile with me (although reception is open to debate).

See everyone in a week or so!
