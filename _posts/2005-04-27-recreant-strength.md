The first draft of a short story for part of an assessment task, that I share in an attempt at publishing non-geek content a little more often here. Or something!

*Recreant Strength* is only available in PDF form at the present time, because it&#8217;d take too long to markup properly, and I&#8217;m not going to trust either Microsoft Word nor OpenOffice to export to HTML cleanly. Because it won&#8217;t.

<small>Damn it, I think I just went and ruined a non-geeky post&#8230; sorry!</small>

[Download *Recreant Strength* here][1].
