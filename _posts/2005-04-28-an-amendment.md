Kindly attack the previous post as much as you want. Vicious criticism is welcomed and requested, seeing as my chances of getting it from teachers are too slim; that&#8217;s not arrogance, that&#8217;s internal school policy which means they can&#8217;t comment on assessments. 

Ridiculous.

In all seriousness, please take to it with a knife (or a pen/keyboard, whatever).
