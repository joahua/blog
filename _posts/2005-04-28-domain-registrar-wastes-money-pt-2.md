I received another 4 letters yesterday from the same company as was responsible for [the original posting][1] on this matter. Of course, I&#8217;m transferring none of the four domains to that registrar, and they sent it by registered mail from the US.

![A pile of letters from DROA][2]

Sucks to be them.

Anyone else received any? Or am I somehow special?

Tangential P.S.: Please please please read and comment on the post [*Recreant Strength*][3]. Please?
