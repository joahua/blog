This month past has regrettably been one in which I haven&#8217;t spent enough time creating content, although March was fairly good, but the traffic didn&#8217;t really falter for it.

**Unique:** 2091  
**Visits:** 4281  
**Pages:** 14158  
**Hits:** 44419  
**Bandwidth:** 484.76 MB

Unique impressions are up by over 600 from last month, suggesting increased driven traffic (from external sites, search engines, etc., which accounted for 13.1% of total traffic, as opposed to incidental traffic &#8211; that is, regular visitors, syndication, etc.). Bandwidth is slightly up on March, exceeding 500MB if non-viewed statistics are included (there was 192.48 MB of non-viewed traffic, which means search engine spidering as well as certain syndication services *I think*), which is getting fairly sizeable I think, especially compared to last year&#8217;s statistics for this month (which aren&#8217;t really valid, because there was a holder page up then, but it&#8217;s fun to point out) &#8212; 2.38MB of traffic and 30 unique visitors!

The most popular post on this website remains the [original DashLite announcement][1], although the updated version doesn&#8217;t really get a look in&#8230; which is okay, because it was released more out of social responsibility than any new *need*, and people can choose for themselves what they want.
