Just an observation, no need to grill me over a seemingly obvious statement. I reserve the proceeding space for musings not guaranteed to be of interest to any other individual on the planet.

Finished Ondaatje&#8217;s &#8220;In The Skin of a Lion&#8221; this afternoon, some time between a catalyst and an idea forming unconsciously whilst reading, and leaping out once it was finished into nothing because I didn&#8217;t have time to write (I was on a bus), so I spoke into the air (I walk along a fairly quiet route home)&#8230; it said nothing back.

Then, a few hours later, I tried to write it again. It happened, it&#8217;s working, albeit somewhat differently to that first elocution and my subsequent expectations of how it would work out &#8212; because it&#8217;s taken on the voice of Ondaatje! I can&#8217;t escape that quasi-poetic/prose mix he spurts forth nearly endlessly! The sentences are fragmented, and it doesn&#8217;t feel natural &#8212; the voice is not my own. It&#8217;s not his, but mine is so affected meaning is lost in translation.

It&#8217;s like drink driving. Intoxication on the creation of others leading to accidents. Disasters. The disaster of inadvertant emulation.
