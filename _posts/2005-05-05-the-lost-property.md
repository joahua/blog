Nothing physical.

I just re-discovered CSS&#8217;s background-position property. I don&#8217;t use it anywhere near enough, and really should. It can do loads of useful stuff &#8211; a good example being the navigation on [Dave Shea&#8217;s mezzoblue][1].

Anyone else been guilty of property neglect lately?
