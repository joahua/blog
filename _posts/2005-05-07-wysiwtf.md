Macromedia&#8217;s Dreamweaver WYSIWYG mode is a bundle of fun, as base10solutions has just discovered during the development of a website that *was* going to be maintained by the client using Dreamweaver.

Here, taken from a normal web browser (it&#8217;s Firefox, but renders the same in IE, so whatever):

The code was exactly the same.
