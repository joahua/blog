We&#8217;re going horrendously overboard and loving every minute of it. The e-voting interface is primed, redesigned, and ready, we&#8217;re planning live vision with instant replays of acts, professional voiceovers courtesy of [Adrian the music nerd][1], and more than a few other surprises &#8212; and that&#8217;s just the technical side of things!

There&#8217;s a lineup of more than 15 talented, not-so-talented-but-amusing, and amusingly bad performances, and tickets are just $5 at the door! Get to the BBC Auditorium on Thursday for a night of great entertainment, with all proceeds going to [Assistance Dogs Australia][2].
