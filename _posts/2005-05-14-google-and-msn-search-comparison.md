[Google and MSN search comparison][1] &#8211; Interesting, if nothing else.

Ironically, use of mod_rewrite and other such utilities to build &#8220;friendly URI&#8217;s&#8221; to provide more keywords for engines to grip on IIS platforms is far more complicated than with Apache!

Anyway, regardless, I&#8217;m sticking with Apache for the time being&#8230;
