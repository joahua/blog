I think, if I had my time again, I&#8217;d start a new blog for Extension 2 and eventually print it all and paste it into a journal. I would write more often, from anywhere in the world, and everything would be centralised, linear. &#8220;Boring&#8221;, but all there. If I wanted to include things I&#8217;d drawn or diagrams, etc, I&#8217;d scan them&#8230; I go to that sort of effort, absurdly, whilst not bothering for a plain physical medium.

It&#8217;d certainly beat the anarchy which currently passes for a &#8220;journal&#8221; of the process of composition in months past! At some point in the next two weeks, I somehow need to sit down and sift, paste, annotate, and generally make intelligible the dribble of work that has been steadily produced (although never consolidated into one) over the past months, before I&#8217;m required to submit that thing for marking.
