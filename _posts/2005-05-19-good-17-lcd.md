I&#8217;m starting to get a tad sick of my trusty 9 year-old ViewSonic 15GS-3 CRT monitor, with my eyes suffering somewhat due to the inevitable compromise between resolution (screen real estate) and refresh rate (headache-inducing flicker).

It puts up an admirable performance for a 15&#8243; monitor (I&#8217;d say probably the best I&#8217;ve ever used), and manages 1280\*1024 at 60Hz just fine &#8211; but a 15&#8243; screen really isn&#8217;t meant to be run at that kind of resolution, and 60Hz is just TOO low (I can&#8217;t generally pick flicker above 85Hz, but anything below and it&#8217;s unpleasant) a refresh rate to use permanently.

The problem with screen resolutions is that it&#8217;s impossible to ever go DOWN a notch &#8211; I used to run at 1024, then shifted to 1152 for ages, and have recently switched to 1280 to make life easier. All this on the same monitor! So I&#8217;m wishing I had a bigger, unflickery screen right about now.

Does anyone have recommendations for a 17&#8243; LCD? Looking for something which does 1280\*1024 and has DVI (VGA would be cool, too) input. The response time isn&#8217;t particularly important as I don&#8217;t do video or games&#8230;
