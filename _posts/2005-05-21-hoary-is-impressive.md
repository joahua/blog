For a hedgehog.

No, really &#8211; it&#8217;s like Warty, only beautiful. It feels like a far more mature system, and everything just works. They&#8217;ve switched it to X.org from the old X server, and the font rendering shows it. Applications which previously clawed your eyes out when upgrades were attempted now work flawlessly (most notably Firefox and Liferea, for myself). Audio works a charm, with even XMMS now playing nice.

It&#8217;s good.

Mostly because of the interfaces.

In related news, I downloaded that ISO and didn&#8217;t use it &#8211; no big deal, seeing as I grabbed it from [files.bigpond.com][1] (doesn&#8217;t count towards my quota) and it went quickly &#8211; because it&#8217;s possible to simply edit the `sources.list` file and use Synaptic to update everything!

Basically change all references from &#8220;warty&#8221; to &#8220;hoary&#8221; in your `sources.list` file ( `/etc/apt/sources.list` ) and run Synaptic. Took me about an hour and a half from editing the sources.list file to a completed upgrade, no breakages.

Good work, [Ubuntu][2]!
