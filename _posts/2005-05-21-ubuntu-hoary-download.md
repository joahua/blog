Thought I&#8217;d just praise Bigpond for a moment, seeing it doesn&#8217;t happen very often.

I just downloaded the latest version of Ubuntu using `wget`. The numbers speak for themselves:

18:50:56 (1.09 MB/s) &#8211; \`ubuntu-5.04-install-i386.iso&#8217; saved [615,307,264/615,307,264]

I was also browsing at normal speed, whilst streaming 96kbps audio and watching Flash video. Cool for $AU60 a month, hey?
