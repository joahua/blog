The Sydney Morning Herald has had a series of rather unfortunate snippets published of late. I found them immensely amusing (perhaps I&#8217;m just childish), and thought I&#8217;d share two.

From the article [Six stranded on Luna Park ride][1], the closing paragraph reads thus:

&#8220;That accident was believed to have been caused by a cap which blew off a passenger&#8217;s head and caught in the Mad Mouse&#8217;s car wheels.&#8221;

Just for the record, no-one was injured in this incident &#8211; It&#8217;s just a crap sentence.

And then there was this headline (probably by now ubiquitous due to syndicated news services &#8211; this one was from AP) &#8212; &#8220;[Probe ordered into Saddam underwear photos.][2]&#8221; I&#8217;ll leave the misreading of this to the reader&#8230; again, maybe I&#8217;m just childish!

***UPDATE:*** The Saddam headline didn&#8217;t make it to the next edition&#8217;s print, but no such qualms were had about printing the last paragraph of the Luna Park article&#8230; ahhh, journalists.
