One of the strangest sensations I&#8217;ve experienced recently is reading something I&#8217;ve written as little as a day or two later and wondering if I really wrote it. It happened to me just then, and it was absolutely bizarre.

Not the content so much as the style &#8211; this was completely foreign, as though it had been written by someone else. That I was reading it having just tabbed from a slightly-more-conversational chat session into it probably exacerbated its apparent distance, but even without this, I think it would have felt as though written by another person.

Stranger still, it doesn&#8217;t even reflect the style of anything else I&#8217;ve recently read, so this difference can&#8217;t simply be attributed to an &#8216;inherited&#8217; or acquired voice&#8230; at least, not explicitly. Either way, it&#8217;s a bizarre feeling reading something you know you wrote and finding it completely unknown!
