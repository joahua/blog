I stumbled across the website of [Huh?][1], an &#8220;enclave of new-age e-movers.&#8221;

<blockquote cite="http://www.huhcorp.com/strategies.htm">
  <p>
    If you&#8217;re still not convinced, we&#8217;ll show you lots of marketing research and consulting cost analysis and global design positioning strategy reports to confuse you and hopefully convince you that we&#8217;re so knowledgeable you couldn&#8217;t possibly succeed without us. Because you can&#8217;t. So don&#8217;t even try.

Quality stuff!
