Or, how to end a content-drought. It seemed fitting that content should come from one of the things that has distracted me from producing content here!

Two people (Alex M and Dean) bothered to get dressed up for today&#8217;s festivi&#8230; err&#8230; assessment, pictured here for your amusement&#8230; or their humiliation&#8230; or something.

<img src="/blog/wp-content/2005/05/alex-crop.jpg" width="186" height="400" alt="Alex, dressed as Ralph from The Portrait of a Lady." /><img src="/blog/wp-content/2005/05/dean-crop-sharp.jpg" width="248" height="400" alt="Dean, dressed up... as himself... or at least no-one in particular from the nineteenth century!" />

Theoretically, this is an academically focussed class, although some would have us think otherwise. [A video, featuring Alex M and Marcelo][1], (2.1MB, WMV format) for your amusement. It quickly dissolved into&#8230; something else!

*Sorry Mac (or Linux!) users, no other formats at this time, until I can figure out how to compress Xvid well enough (at best, slightly more than twice the size of the WMV).*
