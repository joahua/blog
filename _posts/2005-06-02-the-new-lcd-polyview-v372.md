I got my new 17&#8243; LCD today, from one of [Michael][1]&#8216;s friends, [Byrn][2]. It&#8217;s a [CMV Polyview V372][3], which doesn&#8217;t inspire images of enormous promotional spending creating a new household name, but, from first impressions, I&#8217;m pretty happy with the quality thus far.

It looks something like this, with funky fullscreen visualisations:

Something less obvious in that picture is that it also has two in-built speakers. Most people would advise against using them, and generally I&#8217;d agree, but I don&#8217;t have any other speakers attached to this computer (Pioneer headphones only), so it&#8217;s good for simple system sounds and radio-kinda-quality music. Obviously not pumping bass, but I&#8217;ve got the [Acoustic Research speakers][5] in my room if I want that, so it&#8217;s no big deal.

The monitor sports DVI and VGA inputs (there&#8217;s a VGA-only model, but the DVI models all come with analogue input as well), and a native resolution of 1280\*1024. They also have an 8ms response time, which would be important to me if I played games, but&#8230; well&#8230; I don&#8217;t. The 14ms version was cheaper, but not enough so to make me want to save the money (there was only $20 in it).

Being an LCD, there&#8217;s the inherent risk of stuck-on or stuck-off pixels and subpixels&#8230; so that was one of the first things I checked. I only found *one* stuck pixel, which is stuck-on (that&#8217;s more obvious than stuck off) &#8211; but it&#8217;s only a subpixel, and it&#8217;s towards the very bottom of the screen &#8211; I didn&#8217;t notice until I pulled up a fullscreen black image.

For comparison, there&#8217;s a spec of dust above the text (erm&#8230; there on purpose, yes&#8230; okay, so I couldn&#8217;t be bothered to clean it). No big deal.

I&#8217;m glad there weren&#8217;t more, though, because Polyview&#8217;s replacement policy doesn&#8217;t kick in until 7 dead pixels according to some websites. It&#8217;s also good it&#8217;s on the side of the screen, rather than dead centre. My old CRT (now sitting on the floor &#8211; I might whack a second graphics card in and try dual monitors when I get time, but probably not) had a burnt-in semi-colon in the middle of the screen, so I knew what having somethind dead-centre could be like. It&#8217;s not too much of a distraction, but hardly desirable.

In a bizarre usability bug, the contrast slider is actually setup the wrong way around. Zero is what would normally be 100, and 100 is zero. This would be not-too-weird, but for the fact that the *brightness* slider is setup &#8220;normally&#8221;. Go figure. So it took me a little longer to get the picture I wanted than perhaps it should have! I was a little worried the display completely sucked for a few minutes there, but, fortunately, it doesn&#8217;t.

When I actually started using it for day-to-day stuff, the thing I was most impressed with was actually a terminal display! This sounds stupid, but I use xterm (no bloat&#8230; what can I say!), which has stupidly tiny font sizes. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a way to change this in software, but I hadn&#8217;t found it, and, with this display, I honestly don&#8217;t think I need to!

It&#8217;s not just the extra size, but the crispness of display in general &#8211; it&#8217;s great. Speaking of crispness, the interface of this thing has another odd quirk &#8211; you can adjust &#8220;sharpness&#8221; in the menu. Set this to 5 straight away, because it appears just to be blurring pixels into each other. Some would call it anti-aliasing, but really, this should be handled at a software level (and usually is) &#8211; the monitor just makes things look like crap.

Overall, it&#8217;s a pretty nice display, with a few rather sad interface flaws, but no serious problems.
