> Such corporate blather is everywhere these days. Credit Joseph Goebbels perhaps, the man who said that if you repeat a lie often enough it becomes the &#8220;truth&#8221;. His only regret must be that he forgot to send letters to every house in Poland a week before the storm-troopers arrived, informing them how their lives were about to become easier and more convenient, and how the only real change to their service was that everything would suddenly be in German.
