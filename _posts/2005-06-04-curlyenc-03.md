In response to [a request from someone on the WordPress forums][1], I&#8217;ve added a heap of characters processed by [CurlyEnc][2]. It also now processes using an array, which would be marginally faster, I&#8217;d imagine. In this version, chances are if your word processor can generate a character, this will parse it into its corresponding entity.

As always, two versions &#8211; [plain text][3] and [PHPS syntax-highlighted][4].
