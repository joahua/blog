[<img src='/blog/wp-content/2005/06/mediacracy.jpg' alt='Mediacracy cover image' style='float:right;' /> Mediacracy][1] is a bunch of interesting audio pieces, alluded to in [an article in Icon in the SMH][2] a few days back, which remix sound bites to produce messages perhaps contrary to the intent of their original speakers.

My personal favorite is &#8220;Howard Killed&#8221; (not for political reasons, just because it&#8217;s *so well produced*!). This&#8217;d be a good text for those in year 12 looking for something to do a portrayal of truth speech on for English&#8230;

As an aside, all of that is released on [archive.org][3] &#8211; it&#8217;s good to see artists embracing the service!
