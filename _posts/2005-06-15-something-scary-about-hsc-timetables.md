Despite more than 60,000 students in NSW doing their HSC this year, the first three personal timetables listed when a Google search for &#8220;HSC timetable&#8221; is conducted are those of people known to me. My [timetable][1] is ranking highest, probably because of incoming links and the relative freshness of information, then [Dale&#8217;s from last year][2] (ranked not far below, probably because of relative age of the document), then, on the next page, [Ben&#8217;s timetable][3] posted a few days ago &#8211; I&#8217;d imagine because of incoming links, though the fact it&#8217;s not in a table may have something to do with it.

Does that strike anyone else as scary? I&#8217;m so sure we can&#8217;t be the only people *in the state* (of approximately 6.6 million people) to have posted their timetables online! And, if we are, that we all know each other directly &#8211; it&#8217;s a scary extrapolation of the idea of a &#8220;digerati&#8221; into a broader context! Have we formed our own Ã©lite? Does that make us relatively &#8220;heard&#8221; voices in this global community?

Call this an overreaction to search engine optimisation if you will, but I think it&#8217;s significant that three students (or ex-students) in the state who *all know each other* can rank so highly on a term hardly common to them alone &#8211; there is a candidature of approximately 60,000 students, and then there are the relatives and friends of these people to consider. Don&#8217;t laugh at this comment too hard, but *where are the LiveJournal users on the first two pages?* Certainly, *someone* must have posted such information, or, at the very least, a string referring to the same, on their own website.

&#8220;Democracy&#8221; on the web takes on a new tone when viewed like this. Creation of *some* compelling content in a semantic framework apparently entitles one to a greater voice on *any* issue. There are technical limitations to doing it any other way, of course &#8211; but perhaps this suggests that &#8220;the web&#8221; isn&#8217;t quite so democratic as it has often been heralded.
