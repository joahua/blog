I can&#8217;t believe how much I seem to be posting about this class of late, but it just keeps producing such *hilarious* material! Our teacher decided to&#8230; get into the spirit of things, and dramatise a poem somewhat too much. The following is what ensued:

![Mrs. Christie lying in a makeshift 'bed' reciting a poem][1]![Mrs. Christie addresses the class from her... desk/bed][2]

![Mid shot of a dismayed expression on the face of the bedridden][3]![A look of irritation, anger][4]![Dreamily looking upwards][5]

There was going to be video, but the quality of the audio was too poor and I couldn&#8217;t cut together anything interesting enough to justify publishing &#8211; apologies. However, despite this, the last three stills are captures from video.
