Some photographs from last night&#8217;s event in Sydney Town Hall.

And we had the biggest smoke machine I&#8217;d ever seen, right up until someone decided the rolling fog looked tacky and scrapped it&#8230; or something like that. For whatever reason, we didn&#8217;t get to use it for the actual show. Doh! :(
