I&#8217;m just posting so that the RSS mob realises something has indeed changed. ;) Yeah, that was a joke. Kind of. Not a discussion for now, anyway. The theme is built around my film SLR camera, a Pentax Asahi SP 500. Vaguely inspired by [Dale&#8217;s somewhat-cynical comment][1] a few days back, although more out of a knowledge that I really should stop being lazy and build my own theme, and a general re-design itch, I whipped this up over the course of today.

I shot a range of photos of the SLR camera to use as a design base, and eventually wound up chosing one as the main design element, cropping off part of another to integrate within that after some editing (that&#8217;s the &#8220;SC 500&#8243; and serial number you see burnt onto the front of the lens bevel), and scaling one down to use as a background for the search area.

The search area, incidentally, is inspired by a post of Matthom&#8217;s a few months back entitled &#8220;[Attractive, accessible web forms.][2]&#8221; The image I&#8217;ve used is one of the length of the lense &#8211; the theory behind this being that the purpose of a search function, as with the lense on a camera, is to focus and zoom &#8211; one being images, and the other, information.

I&#8217;m thinking the typography doesn&#8217;t feel terribly inspired, but I can deal with that given its clarity. The colours of the post header type, by the way, have nothing to do with Flickr &#8211; the link and link hover colours used to be more pink and more light blue before I noticed how similar it looked to Flickr&#8217;s branding! I&#8217;ve shifted it down a bit, but I thought I&#8217;d clarify now that any resemblence is purely incidental, before someone else said anything.

I haven&#8217;t decided if the header is cool or annoying yet. I wanted it to be apparently complex, ideally without needing to use images, but I don&#8217;t know if this is taking things a little too far &#8211; hover back and forwards too quickly and it is a confusing experience. The interface can be simplified easily, but I thought I&#8217;d ask for feedback on the weird/trippy version first.

#### Changes in summary

*   IMO cleaner markup than Placid (the previously used theme by Chris Lin)
*   Also lighter (bandwidth wise). This theme is a 58KB template, Placid was 130KB. Partially code/markup, but largely images. Reduced use of images in this template will also reduce hits and thus improve loading times.
*   Optimised for wider screens: fluid layout, works best from 1024 upwards. Motivated at least in part by my own acquisition of more screen real estate recently
*   Built *for* WordPress 1.5 from the ground up &#8211; the first theme I&#8217;ve developed myself for this website that&#8217;s had that advantage
*   Inclusion of a &#8220;Recent Comments&#8221; section
*   3 column layout using absolute positioning
*   &#8220;Bright&#8221; design, because I&#8217;ve been accused of always coming up with darker colour schemes, etc.
