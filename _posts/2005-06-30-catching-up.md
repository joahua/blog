A few things to post about that I haven&#8217;t, or that I&#8217;ve started typing and had a system crash halfway through.

*   <img src="/blog/wp-content/2005/06/waroftheworlds.jpg" alt="War of the Worlds poster" style="float:right" />I saw (most of) *War of the Worlds* with Tori yesterday at Chatswood Hoyts. I got annoyed with the &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t steal a car [...] Piracy is theft.&#8221; promotion at the beginning more out of habit than anything specific to the occasion (more on that some other time), but later there was a bit more of a reason to be agitated. Aliens walk around, zap people, act like mosquitos, cover earth in blood as fertiliser&#8211;and then the sound cuts out. There was probably about 15 minutes of the film to go, and I&#8217;m sure it wasn&#8217;t really *that* great, and they *did* give full refunds: but that wouldn&#8217;t have happened if we&#8217;d downloaded the film and watched it at home! Yeah, okay, things go wrong &#8211; but the system clearly had been showing some signs of problems for a while &#8212; even the ads before the feature had sound cutting in and out. [Cinema advertisers][1] take note: Cinema may be &#8220;Australia&#8217;s Fastest Growing National Advertising Medium&#8221; (with too many capitalised words), but it&#8217;s growing, ahem, rather silently. Anti-anti-piracy rant here.
*   [WordPress 1.5.1.3][2] has been released, and mere mortals should not try to upgrade using SVN: you&#8217;ll migrate to 1.6alpha. I know this because I did it yesterday, then, thanks to a recentish backup, successfully rolled back without any client-side downtime to speak of.

I could put in a massive anti-anti-piracy rant here (notably *not* a pro-piracy rant &#8211; and yes, there is a distinction) but I don&#8217;t think anyone ever actually reads those!
