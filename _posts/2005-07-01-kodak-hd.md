High definition? Huge disaster? Horrible disappointment? Heinously difficult?

![Photo of a roll of Kodak HD film][1]

I went to buy a three-pack of 24 exposure 35mm film for my SP 500 today, and, because it was on special (probably because the film expires next month), treated myself to Kodak&#8217;s over-marketed offering that I&#8217;ve always been a little dubious about. Disclaimer at this point &#8211; I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything *technically* wrong with the film by any stretch of the imagination. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll produce great shots. But the branding and marketing of this doesn&#8217;t exactly assist the photographer (I *so* nearly wrote &#8220;end user&#8221; there &#8211; must get out more.) in capturing great shots, at least not in terms of exposure.

To explain: this film is billed as being multi-purpose. It does everything. Apparently. It also does it well. Apparently.

Okay, nothing wrong with that. You *could* use good quality ISO100 stock to do &#8220;everything&#8221;, albeit with a little bit of pain. By the same token, this film stock does &#8220;everything&#8221;. It&#8217;d just help if I&#8217;d known what I was using *before* I got home and had time to [look up the specs][2] online.

The bottom line is this: on the exterior packaging there is absolutely no mention of the speed of the film enclosed, aside from fleeting comparisons to other Kodak products, saying &#8220;look, this is better, it does more stuff&#8221; &#8211; never mind that if you inspect closely it&#8217;s actually slightly *different* stuff. Deceptive marketing certainly plays a part in the problem.

So, I couldn&#8217;t find information about that anywhere on the packaging. I loaded it into my camera and ran off a roll of it, with the ISO speed set to 400 (that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d personally consider fairly *useful*, if not overly versatile &#8211; certainly something I&#8217;d consider probable if they&#8217;re marketing a consumer brand high-quality stock), trying not to worry too much about it.

![Adjusting exposure and ASA (ISO) speed assigned][3]

Yeah, a recipe for disaster.

I got home, checked Kodak&#8217;s specs, and it turns out the film was ISO/ASA/DIN/whatever you want to call it 200 speed film. Nothing I can do about it now, of course, apart from hope that post-processing will be able to clean up the underexposed mess. I went and had a closer look at the cartridge after I&#8217;d thought about it for a bit, and it *does* say the speed on the side of it &#8211; but of course, I didn&#8217;t think to check this until I&#8217;d already wound the film on, so even had I thought of it at the time it wasn&#8217;t the best option.

Why can&#8217;t film manufacturers label their products more thoroughly and cut down on overhyped marketing that fails to actually inform the consumer of what their product *is*?
