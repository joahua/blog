I [stumbled across this post][1] &#8211; from about three years ago &#8211; today, and thought it was incredibly cool. Note that the background on the second layer in is similarly encoded&#8230; nifty beyond.

<small>Via <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/">Anne&#8217;s weblog</a> in a roundabout kind of way.</small>

Absolutely no idea if any of that works in Internet Explorer&#8230; if you&#8217;re an IE person and it works/doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;d be great to see a comment&#8230;

On an unrelated note, lack of posting over this last week has been due to a [Crusaders][2]-run study camp at&#8230; somewhere without Internet access&#8230; Galston-ish. If nothing else, it was good for the habit/schedule of study and talks throughout the week!

*Regular programming shall return shortly&#8230; although possibly not until after Trial exams in a month or so.*
