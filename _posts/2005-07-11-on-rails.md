[<img src="/blog/wp-content/2005/07/rails_logo_remix.gif" alt="Rails logo" style="float:left;" />][1] I&#8217;ve heard lots about [Ruby on] Rails over the last several months, but never really bothered to find out what it was about/what it *did* differently until today, when their website was [featured on Stylegala][2]. Yeah, procrastination takes strange forms &#8211; I found myself inexplicably drawn to the content of this website, with a desire to discover everything about this system.

Okay, not quite.

I saw a [link to a video][3], and went and viewed that.

It was interesting, surprising, astounding. The &#8220;[Rails Academy][5]&#8221; contains a series of video tutorials, of which I have watched only one that demonstrates how to create a (rudimentary) blog system in under 15 minutes, with something like 60 lines of code. Oh, and you get used to the accent in the video pretty quickly.

I&#8217;m really impressed. I&#8217;m almost afraid to start using it, because I think I&#8217;ll like it so much that there&#8217;ll be problems with deployment when web hosts don&#8217;t have Ruby/Rails installed! Hopefully I&#8217;ll have more to report on this front in a few months time.
