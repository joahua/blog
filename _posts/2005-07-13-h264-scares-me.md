<p>In an &#8220;its coolness chills me to the bone&#8221; kind of way.  I&#8217;m scared because of <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/quicktime/hdgallery/recommendations.html">what it apparently requires</a>, and I&#8217;m scared because of the supposed quality of it.  I&#8217;ve downloaded &#8212; probably foolishly &#8212; <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/quicktime/hdgallery/batmanbegins.html">a trailer for Batman Begins</a> (hey, there isn&#8217;t much material out there!) in 1920&#215;1080 resolution, and all my computer could do was crash.  In Totem (xine) <em>and</em> MPlayer.  Apparently <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design7/news.html#mplayer10pre7">the latest version of MPlayer should work with H.264</a>, but I&#8217;m not prepared to break my apt upgrading in order to test before the official packages are available &#8211; impatient though I am to see my <a href="http://home.joahua.com/phpsysinfo/">Athlon 2200+ with 768MB of RAM</a> get absolutely punished during playback of this video, I can wait a week or two.</p>
<p>Having said that, however, MPlayer <em>did</em> manage to decode the first 25 frames of (strangely enough) the higher resolution (1920&#215;1080) video.  If I had to give a reason for the image appearing to have bled, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s because the application was failing to decode each frame in realtime, although I&#8217;m sure there are far more plausible explanations out there (like, oh, let&#8217;s see &#8211; the application doesn&#8217;t officially even support H.264 at all in that version?).  You can click on the image below to see a ratings advisory screen in truely mean detail, even if it has bled a bit.  And been compressed a bit.  Okay, so it&#8217;s not really that great &#8211; but the resolution!</p>

<p>No, the real and present danger at this point is that I will waltz across the room (or, you know, spin my chair around and move two metres or so) to an otherwise-perfectly-okay Pentium 3 running Windows XP, and try installing Quicktime 7 to playback the same file.  Actually, I&#8217;d be perfectly happy if it could adequately playback the 852&#215;480 version, I think.</p>
<p>But then, it&#8217;s Batman, and I don&#8217;t think I could actually care that much&#8230;</p>
