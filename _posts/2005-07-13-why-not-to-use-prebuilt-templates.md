<a href="http://www.switch.com.au/" rel="nofollow">This highly respectable ISP</a> has had their website designed by <a href="http://www.dwd.com.au/" rel="nofollow">a highly respectable web design firm</a>, and has consequently come out looking substantially different from every other third- or fourth-tier web services retailer on the market.

![A screenshot of their website][1]

Note their wonderfully original Flash banner. Look closer. Right click on the movie and hit &#8220;Rewind&#8221;. What you thought you could see before but didn&#8217;t really want to believe anyone could be stupid enough to do has come true. For those who can&#8217;t be bothered going to their website and/or don&#8217;t have Flash installed, observe my screenshot above. Beneath their logo there is indeed text that reads &#8220;Company Name.net&#8221;.

Charming. But not quite so charming as this little gem from <a href="http://www.dwd.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Driver Web Designers</a>: &#8220;We offer our customers the services of a professional inhouse Graphic designer to give your Website the edge over the competition.&#8221;

Ummm.

Better than all that still, of course, is the fact that their brand name as proudly displayed not only on their own banner, but also on the Driver Web Designers website, points not to their own website (which is switch.com.au) but rather that of [Union Switch & Signal][2].

Yeah, I used `rel="nofollow"` on some links in this post to prevent Google from counting them in its index. It&#8217;s because some stupidity doesn&#8217;t bear following.
