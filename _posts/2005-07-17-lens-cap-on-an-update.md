#### An update

Sun, 17 Jul 2005 11:15:27 +0000

There is now *a* server back up, [official status updates can be found here][1].

<ins>It turned out this wasn&#8217;t the normal server&#8211;I&#8217;d assumed it wouldn&#8217;t be&#8211;but Michael did provide updates online from that point onwards (though mailing list reports were both more comprehensive and frequent).</ins>
