<img src="/blog/wp-content/2005/07/viking.jpg" alt="A viking!" style="float:left;" />At approximately 22:09, web services came back online near-completely. This weblog should be functioning perfectly, though there&#8217;s a few quirky things happening around the place which will be attended to as quickly as possible.

Hi again. Glad I figured out how to take off that lens cap&#8230; (and thanks, Michael, for getting stuff sorted out!)

<ins>Update, July 19: Michael has <a href="http://www.bluetrait.com/archive/2005/07/18/its-alive-mahah/">posted briefly about it</a>, apparently there&#8217;s more to come, though.

    &#8230;And I&#8217;ve learnt to use the <code>&lt;INS&gt;</code> tag!</ins>

    Now, we&#8217;ve got (slightly less pot-bellied than the one pictured) VIKINGS to protect us with their <abbr title="Redundant Array of Independent Drives">RAID</abbr>!! Tis exciting times indeed! Yarrr!

    Okay, so we don&#8217;t have vikings. We do, however, have a redundant array of independent drives, which is <em>nearly</em> as exciting as those piratical Scandinavians&#8230;
