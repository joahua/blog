<p>Just to get bandwidth utilisation back to normal, or something ;)  The file is 14424 pixels wide, and 407 high.  It&#8217;s been manually stitched, and isn&#8217;t <em>too</em> bad, given I shot the sequence in under two minutes with no great degree of accuracy.  623<acronym title="KiloByte">KB</acronym> JPEG.

<p>If you do happen to click through, note the cloud of smoke spreading from the bushfires!  It looks even cooler in these photos:</p>

This one reminds me of the spreading cloud of darkness around&#8230; that bad place in Lord of the Rings (I&#8217;ve read it, but only endured the first movie&#8211;no, I&#8217;m not a fan, sorry world).  Only it&#8217;s not quite so dark.  But it reminds me of it anyway. Picture Lord of the Rings with an ugly damn and some sheds in it, or something (I couldn&#8217;t satisfactorily crop it, sorry!)&#8230;</p>

I&#8217;m convinced it looks like there are mushroom clouds in this one&#8230; but&#8230; there&#8217;s not.  Looks like explosions in the distance, but the colour (once tweaked a bit) comes out nicely in the photo, in my opinion.</p>
