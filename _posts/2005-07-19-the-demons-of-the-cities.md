By German poet, Georg Heym, written at some point in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century (or maybe very late 19<sup>th</sup> C.), that doesn&#8217;t appear to be anywhere online (despite being on several university reading lists).<img style="float: right;" src="/blog/wp-content/2005/07/demon.jpg" alt="" />

> The midnight cities cower underfoot;  
> The demons trample through the urban graves;  
> Their skipper-beards, a sprout of smoke and soot,  
> Bristle like chins of Charons needing shaves.
> 
> Creeping on fog-shoes where the pavement drowses  
> And crawling forward slowly room by room,  
> Their shadows waver over waves of houses  
> And gobble street-lights in the black gulps of gloom.
> 
> Their knees are kneeling on the city towers,  
> Their feet make footstools of the city squares,  
> And where the rain strews down its bleakest flowers  
> Their stormy pipe of Pan rears up and blares.
> 
> Around their feet each cityâ€™s dark refrain  
> Is circling like a rondo of the waters.  
> An ode to death. Now faint, now shrill again,  
> The dirge ebbs into darkness till it falters.
> 
> The stream they stroll on is a snaky glow,  
> Its dim back speckled by the yellow glimmer  
> The lanterns â€“ blanketed in the black-out â€“ throw.  
> The melancholy reptile wallows.
> 
> Their weight falls heavy on a bridgeâ€™s railing  
> Each time their hands fall heavy into swarms  
> Of urban flesh, as if some faun were flailing  
> Across a slimy swamp his outstretched arms.
> 
> Now one stands up. He hangs a ghoulâ€™s black mask  
> On the white moon. The leaden heavens spill  
> Down darkly from a heaven darker still,  
> Crushing the houses in a jet-black cask.
> 
> A snapping sound. A cityâ€™s backbone splits.  
> A roof cracks open, reddening its rent  
> With arson. Demons squat on it like cats  
> And ululate into the firmament.
> 
> A spawning mother bawls where midnight billows;  
> The steep crescendo of each labour pang  
> Arches her brawny pelvis from its pillows;  
> Around her the enormous devils throng.  
> Sheâ€™s tossed yet anchored. Overhead, her bedâ€™s  
> Whole ceiling shakes with howlings of the tortured.  
> Red furrow â€“ redder; longer. Now the orchard  
> Brings forth the fruit. It rips her womb to shreds.
> 
> The devilâ€™s necks are growing like giraffesâ€™.  
> The baby has no head. The mother lugs  
> It with her till she faints; a devil laughs;  
> Her spine is tickled by cold thumbs of frogs.
> 
> Tossing their horns, the demons grow so tall  
> They gash the very sky for blood to plunder.  
> Through laps of cities roars their earthquake-thunder  
> While lightning sizzles where their hoofbeats fall.

Another version reads thus:

> They wander through the cities night enshrouds:  
> The cities cower, black, beneath their feet.  
> Upon their chins like sailors&#8217; beards the clouds  
> Are black with curling smoke and sooty sleet.
> 
> On seas of houses their long shadow sways  
> And snuffs ranked street-lamps out, as with a blow.  
> Upon the pavement, thick as fog, it weighs,  
> And gropes from house to house, solid and slow.
> 
> With one foot planted on a city square,  
> The other knee upon a tower, they stand,  
> And where the black rain falls they rear, with blare  
> Of quickened Pan&#8217;s-pipes in a cloud-stormed land.
> 
> About their feet circles a ritornelle  
> With the sad music of the city&#8217;s sea,  
> Like a great burying-song. The shrill tones swell  
> And rumble in the darkness, changefully.
> 
> They wander to the stream that, dark and wide,  
> As a bright reptile with gold-spotted back,  
> Turns in the lanterned dark from side to side  
> In its sad dance, while heaven&#8217;s stare is black.
> 
> They lean upon the bridge, darkly agog,  
> And thrust their hands among the crowds that pass,  
> Like fauns who perch above a meadow bog  
> And plunge lean arms into the miry mass.
> 
> Now one stands up. He hangs a mask of gloom  
> Upon the white-cheeked moon. The night, like lead  
> From the dun heavens, settles as a doom  
> On houses into pitted darkness fled.
> 
> The shoulders of the cities crack. A gleam  
> Of fire from a roof burst open flies  
> Into the air. Big-boned, on the top beam  
> They sit and scream like cats against the skies.
> 
> A little room with glimmering shadows billows  
> Where one in labor shrieks her agony.  
> Her body lifts gigantic from the pillows.  
> And the huge devils stand about to see.
> 
> She clutches, shaking, at her torture-bed.  
> With her long shuddering cry the chamber heaves.  
> Now the fruit comes. Her womb gapes long and red,  
> And bleeding, for the child&#8217;s last passage cleaves.
> 
> The devils&#8217; necks grow like giraffes&#8217;. The child  
> Is born without a head. The mother moans  
> And holds it. On her back, clammy and wild,  
> The frog-fingers of fear play, as she swoons.
> 
> But vast as giants now the demons loom.  
> Their horns in fury gore the bleeding skies.  
> An earthquake thunders in the cities&#8217; womb  
> About their hooves, where flint-struck fires rise.
