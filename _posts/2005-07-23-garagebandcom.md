<p>Tori pointed me to some music on this website today and it&#8217;s surprisingly good quality&#8230; at least, so far as I can judge &#8212; which is confined to &#8220;well produced&#8221; and &#8220;that sounds good/nice&#8221;!  At least some of it is under Creative Commons licensing, which is interesting.  Good stuff.</p>
<p>Oh, and a tip:  Personally, I think the best way to listen is to go to a genre you&#8217;re a fan of and start a player with all tracks and just keep clicking &#8220;Next&#8221; if you don&#8217;t like a particular track.  Of course, you can download all the material as well, but if you want to use it like streaming radio then that&#8217;s the way to go.</p>
