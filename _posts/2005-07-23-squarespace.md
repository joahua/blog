I know there&#8217;s more than a few emerging weblog hosting services out there, but I just discovered [Squarespace][1] via a text-based advertisement in Opera&#8217;s banner (I&#8217;m astounded how unintrusive they are&#8230; I think I&#8217;m actually *appreciating* them, which is amazing!), and was instantly impressed by their website&#8217;s interface and copy.

Apparently it&#8217;s been [creating some noise in mainstream media][2], too. I look at it and I don&#8217;t see another content management system people are trying to sell &#8212; the website looks, feels, and reads as though it&#8217;s a small community project. Which it probably isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;d imagine they&#8217;re making loads of money off this thing. And good on them: it appears they&#8217;ve jumped on the [Cluetrain][3], come up with a killer offering, and it&#8217;s worked for them.

&#8220;Killer offering&#8221;, by the way, is not just weblog software. It&#8217;s also not just *managed* weblog software or even web services&#8230; it&#8217;s commerical, managed, web publishing services that people are crying out for. [Six Apart][4] have sort of leant in, but they&#8217;re first and foremost a blogging company, whilst Squarespace positions themself in a broader market: they&#8217;re a *publishing* company, that [lets you do blogging][5], if that&#8217;s your thing.

I&#8217;ve observed all this in the course of about ten minutes, by the way. I haven&#8217;t even tried the service yet: this is all in response to their presentation and promotion. Incidentally, Squarespace also [have their own blog][6] &#8212; part of that whole Cluetrain thing &#8212; and have content on it available to anyone under a [Creative Commons license][7]. What a cool tech company&#8230;
