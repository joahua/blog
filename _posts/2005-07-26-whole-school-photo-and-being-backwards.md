<p>Today the whole of St. Andrews converged on Sydney Square for a whole-school photo that&#8217;s now happening approximately once every five years.</p>

<p>Inevitably, a little stupidity ensued:</p>

<p>To quote Ben, with a little bit of&#8230; creative subediting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Finding the day: five weeks.<br />
Getting 1100 students to behave: two hours, three detentions, and an airbrush tool.<br />
Whole school photo: priceless.</p>
<p>&#8230;For everything else, there&#8217;s the St. Andrew&#8217;s VISA card.  (I hope they&#8217;re not still doing that, but such a beast <em>did</em> exist at one point&#8230;)</p></blockquote>
