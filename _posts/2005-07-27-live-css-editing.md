Note to self.

Live CSS editing is all fun and games until someone loses half an hour of rather intense work because they forgot that live CSS editing doesn&#8217;t include a &#8220;save&#8221; feature, and resets if you accidentally click a link to open in a new tab.

I&#8217;d recommend [Firefox Web Developer Extension][1] should bear warnings to this effect when using live CSS editing, but it&#8217;s entirely possible no-one else has such moments of monumental stupidity. I&#8217;m beginning to think that this tool has become a little *too* integrated into my development process&#8230; (but that&#8217;s only because it&#8217;s so completely indisposably awesome)
