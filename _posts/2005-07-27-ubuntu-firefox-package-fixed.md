<ins><strong>Update: There are still some notable flaws in this package. Various components do not function, most importantly the Preferences (Edit -> Preferences) but also various XUL package installation elements. Proceed with caution.</strong></ins>

It appears they&#8217;ve fixed [the segfault problem I wrote about a few days ago][1], because they&#8217;ve changed the version number (heh, and presumably a few other things) and now it works fine. Standard Synaptic upgrade should do the trick nicely. This, incidentally, will take you to the latest Firefox version (1.0.6 at time of writing) as opposed to (I think) 1.0.4 in the last (segfaulting) release. For the first time in a while, the repository is actually up to date with Firefox&#8217;s frenetic release cycle!

Not that it matters, really&#8230; none of the bugs reported have been rated critical, or the IT press would have had a field day with it. Besides, the only reason we&#8217;re not seeing the same cycle with IE is that they appear to have temporarily given up, and now only seem to roll out updates with operating system patches (probably not much less regular, but, with Windows now strongly encouraging users to allow auto updating, far less noticable). I&#8217;m still [browsing happy][2] on Firefox.
