Anachronistic.

It can mean outside its proper time, in reference to [an idea that has become an *anachronism*][1] and should have expired&#8230; but I think it&#8217;s more useful for describing a non-linear style (that is, [that ideas exist outside of their historical chronological order][2]).

The word came from no-where in particular, I was just reading an essay and remembered that word but couldn&#8217;t remember what it meant, exactly, so I went and looked it up. The end.
