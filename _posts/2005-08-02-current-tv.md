<p>There&#8217;s a new TV network out there that&#8217;s got a radically different programming model, and looks immensely interesting.  They&#8217;re foward-thinking type people.  This is <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain</a>-model television programming.  And I <em>wish</em> they&#8217;d gone and launched a video stream as well, because neither I (nor anyone else outside the US) can see any of it live &#8211; only what&#8217;s been specifically selected and uploaded to their online <a href="http://www.current.tv/studio/">Current Studio</a> section (not yet live).</p>
<p>(Oh, and if any US people are reading this &#8212; I&#8217;m looking at you, <a href="http://matthom.com/">Matthom</a> ;) &#8212; expecting a full report! :P)</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say some more nice things about them if their website were as foward thinking as they clearly are: they could easily have a validating website if they cared (look ma, no tables&#8230; also no doctype), and streaming is obviously not beyond their reach if they already have the facilities to provide <em>some</em> of their content selectively.</p>
