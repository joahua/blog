Okay, this should hopefully be the last word from me on this. I&#8217;ve discovered there&#8217;s [a bug report on this issue][1] in Ubuntu&#8217;s Bugzilla system, which has some pretty informative comments.

I uninstalled Tabbrowser, Web Developer Toolbar and Image Zoom extensions (as well as FireFTP, but that&#8217;s just because I never use it anymore/it&#8217;s always been too clunky), then restarted Firefox &#8212; presto, the Preferences work again, as does myriad other things. I&#8217;ve reinstalled the Web Developer Toolbar extension as well as Image Zoom, and restarted, and now everything appears to be working as normal again.
