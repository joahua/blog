I&#8217;ve just uploaded the [*Bake the Cake* video][1] from the beginning of the year to [Ourmedia][2]/[Archive.org][3] because my iiNet webspace ceased to exist some months ago now, and it lacked any other permanent home (with sufficient bandwidth).

It&#8217;s still just the WMV file, but I&#8217;m hoping to put a higher resolution version/different media format version up at some point in the future. You can [grab the WMV file here][4], or [view the video&#8217;s page on Ourmedia][5]. If nothing else, consider this an experiment on my part with Ourmedia/Archive.org&#8217;s services.
