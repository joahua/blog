I wrote some months ago about my adventures with [cleaning and rendering useless a motherboard that I&#8217;d found on the side of the road][1], in which I accidentally removed a surface-mounted capacitor from the surface it was mounted on (duh).

![Revised macro shot of the missing capacitor - better focus than the original one.][2]

It appears that capacitor did absolutely nothing.

Earlier this afternoon, I played with a bunch of hardware trying to find some stuff that worked for Marcelo, before establishing that the best of the bunch, the motherboard I&#8217;d broken (or &#8216;broken&#8217;) &#8212; it seemed to be *really good* quality in the whole time I was playing with it &#8212; was absolutely fine. After much changing and plugging and everything else that&#8217;s involved in building a computer from scraps, we wound up with the following specs:

*   Pentium 3 866
*   [Gigabyte 6VXC7-4X-P][3] motherboard
*   384MB of RAM
*   16MB Voodoo3 (2000, I&#8217;m pretty sure&#8230; it had TV-out, too &#8212; as in the socket was there and soldered on &#8212; but the blanking plate covered it&#8230; go figure. Didn&#8217;t have time to pull it apart/an S-Video cable to test.) AGP
*   Two hard drives&#8230; a 10GB (his original) and a 13GB (added)

And it all seems to work without any problems, despite missing that 400<sup>th</sup> capacitor lost one fateful day ;) Ah, I love technology when it just works even when it shouldn&#8217;t!
