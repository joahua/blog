Just before we moved into our new house earlier this year, I posted thirty-nine photos of it (empty). The [first comment][1] read something like this:

Well, today we were chopping a moderate-sized mulberry tree (read: big enough to put a sizable dent in our house, or the house next door, if we weren&#8217;t really careful. Actually, we&#8217;d already had a limb fall on the roof of the neighbours behind us, which we carefully &#8212; and by that I mean with a chainsaw &#8212; removed without any damage) that decided it&#8217;d love to fall into the back of our house. You can sort of see the mulberry tree in [this photo][2]&#8230; it&#8217;s the massive one towards the right of frame, but the sun obscures its density somewhat.

Mercifully, we were cutting high up enough that it didn&#8217;t quite fall far enough to crash into the glass itself &#8212; we hadn&#8217;t thought that far ahead, otherwise we would have shut the [crazy roof shutter things][3] as a precaution &#8212; but it did slam into the back of the house, and the doors were open (because we were running power to outside&#8230; the usual)&#8230; so, presto, our atrium becomes a garden.

I didn&#8217;t think anything of it (aside from &#8220;oh, crap, this is going to take some cleaning up&#8221; and &#8220;oops, there goes the back wall of our house&#8221;, amongst other things) until later, so unfortunately the photo isn&#8217;t as good as it could have been:

Just&#8230; imagine it with a rather dense tree there. It&#8217;s better than a bonsai-filled atrium. It&#8217;s an indoor micro-forest!
