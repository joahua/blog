Watch out [John Collett][1], Business journalist for the Sydney Morning Herald. It appears you&#8217;re being monitored.

The page the link goes to has since been removed, but at the time of writing this is [still visible in the side column of this page][3] &#8212; at any rate, it links to an error page [saying the requested page could not be found][4].
