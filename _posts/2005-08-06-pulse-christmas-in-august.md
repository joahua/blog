Yeah, most people would do &#8220;Christmas in July&#8221;, but apparently we&#8217;re just a slow bunch, so there we go.

I stuck a [bunch of photos from last night][1] up in an album in Photostack, so&#8230; be entertained. Or something!

There was a secret santa thing, just to explain away the [playdough][2] and [egg cups][3]&#8216; (Let me know if that apostrophe is incorrectly placed, someone&#8230;) presence (as well as [the garden gnome just to the edge of frame][4]). But we didn&#8217;t really need excuses to act silly, anyway.
