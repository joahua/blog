![A photo of the cool button][1]

I found this button on an oldish jacket today, and thought it was sufficiently cool to share. The jacket was tailored in New Zealand by some guy/company called Peter Wain (yeah, I&#8217;d never heard of them either&#8230; a quick Google didn&#8217;t turn up anything), and the buttons consist of a cast with significant height, subsequently filled with some clear plastic.
