The most chocolaty hot chocolate I ever had, from an obscure coffee shop in the backwaters of Sydney (in the middle of an industrial/commercial area). I think the location was the strangest part about it all, but the chocolate was&#8230; intense. Very, very rich, and very, very dehydrating ;) As in, if I had a few more, I think I&#8217;d have been as effectively preserved as a mummy.

Good stuff! [Allpress Espresso][2] is the name of the place, and they&#8217;re at 58 Epsom Road, Rosebery, Sydney, NSW 2018. If you happen to be around there (Zetland, Alexandria, Kensington, etc) I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s worth a look in&#8230;
