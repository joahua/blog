Well, it took me a while, but I finally got around to a camera-toting expedition to lower campus [as suggested][1]. Comprehensiveish photo evidence follows.

Just like [the original photo][3] only <del>crunchy</del> focused better. Because my camera is not a phone. \*nods\* ;)

It&#8217;s really a glorified 7-11 or a vending machine that does notes and credit cards, and has cereal in stock. Yes, cereal.

I presume you put your card in the slot labelled &#8220;Notes&#8221;&#8230; I didn&#8217;t actually check. You can&#8217;t quite see it when the photo is scaled down that far, but there&#8217;s actually someone&#8217;s mobile number listed next to &#8220;Info&#8221; at the bottom of the screen&#8230; would you put your phone number on a vending machine? Ah well, at least it&#8217;s not selling prepaid credit (yet).
