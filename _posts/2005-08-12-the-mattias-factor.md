It didn&#8217;t have the [<acronym title="Short Message Service">SMS</acronym> voting, vision mixing and live replays output to multiple displays, or driving around in the small hours of the morning that followed][1], but it was fun nonetheless. Yeah, just another talent quest thing ;)

And yes, the name *is* a typo, again one that stuck. That kind of thing seems to happen a lot. \*Josh glances at domain name, then at Katy\*

I took some video with my little digital Pentax Optio that I quickly cut together tonight and then uploaded it to Ourmedia (hey, it [worked once][3], why not again?). Vaguely amusing stuff, even if the quality isn&#8217;t technically great: hey, I shot it on a still camera and edited it in Windows Movie Maker because it&#8217;s quick and easy and free(-as-in-beer), so purists and professionals can shut up already!

For obvious reasons, that means it&#8217;s only available in Windows media format for the minute. You can [download the short clip (all of 1 minute 41 seconds) from Ourmedia][4]. (roughly 4.6MB)
