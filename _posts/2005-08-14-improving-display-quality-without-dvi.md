The graphics card in my desktop only has a D-Sub/VGA connector, so for the minute at least I&#8217;m stuck using that with [my CMV Polyview V372 LCD monitor][1]. This means some quality issues have come up, mostly when there&#8217;s chunks of fine, alternating, colours (similar to in [the gamma chart illustrated here][2]) or even just large solid areas (sync lines become visible occasionally).

I&#8217;ve moved my computer upstairs for today in order to get chunks of work done away from noise, etc., and only took monitor, keyboard, mouse and computer up: nothing else. This obviously makes cable management far easier. Seemed like the opportune time to <del>procrastinate</del> benchmark improvements in quality.

Okay, so I didn&#8217;t really benchmark. I just observed that it looked better when coils of cable (I had a largish coil on the DC-side of the display&#8217;s transformer sitting right under it that I hadn&#8217;t undone yet), particularly *power* cable, were kept away from the VGA run (and, if they must cross, making those crossings perpendicular). I was convinced I needed to buy a DVI-capable graphics card to get better quality, but this has stepped things up remarkably. One more purchase that can be put off for a while longer!

Having said that, though, buying a new card would probably give me not only marginally better quality by DVI, but also improved colour definition: this TNT2 M64 was never the most wonderful when it came to rich 2D quality.
