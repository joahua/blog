I&#8217;ll probably juggle the order a bit, later on, but I just wanted to get it in and done!

1.  Bachelor of Arts (Advanced) at University of Sydney
2.  Bachelor of Arts (Media and Communications) at University of Sydney
3.  Bachelor of Arts at University of Sydney
4.  Bachelor of Arts (Media and Communications) at University of New South Wales
5.  Bachelor of Education (Sec: Humanities & Social Sciences)/Bachelor of Arts at University of Sydney
6.  Bachelor of International Studies at University of New South Wales
7.  Bachelor of Arts at University of New South Wales
8.  Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Education at University of New South Wales
9.  Bachelor of Arts in Communication (Media Arts & Production) at University of Technology, Sydney

UNSW&#8217;s education programme looks pretty&#8230; something not great. And the UTS course is really just a filler to make up nine. Other than that, I think I&#8217;d be pretty happy with any of those courses (heh, marks almost certainly won&#8217;t permit most of them, but ah well). As an aside, I did sort of succumb to the temptation to put higher-mark courses first, but&#8230; meh!
