Their website sucks. Really, a lot. Muchly. I don&#8217;t care about the markup: it&#8217;s just plain unusable. Form submission times out without warning that there is a time limit on applications, copy flaws abound: the website is just crap, in every sense of the word (well, okay, the design is mediocre, not crap, but everything else is crap. Very.)
