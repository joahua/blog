I took these photos over the last night or two with my digital camera. The reason the moon is this large/detailed is (mostly) that I&#8217;ve cropped the images to this size, and was using maximum optical zoom on the camera itself when I took the photos (which is why the third is so blurry, I guess!)

The third image, as well as the last two, were shot through a filter (not a later digital filter, but optical) &#8212; I&#8217;m not entirely sure why the colours are so different, truth be told!

The second and third photos are just overexposed &#8212; the only difference is that I held my hand adequately steady for the second, whilst in the third it slipped a bit. I&#8217;m noticing a resemblance to the [Lucidien brand][1] in how that photo came out, but their logo is produced with Photoshop effects, not taken from a photo. But hey, a cool look nonetheless!
