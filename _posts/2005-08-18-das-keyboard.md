<p>This looks really cool, and logically [the absence of letter markings] makes more sense than perhaps it first seems.  Enforced dependence upon memory will remove the need for <em>any</em> consultation with the markings on the keyboard in a fairly short period of time.  The creator <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/hardware/solely-for-geeks/2005/08/12/1123353459510.html" title="SMH article - see closing paragraph">likened it to</a> the absence of key labellings on a piano, which is&#8230; only semi-valid, I guess, as there are only 7 keys on a piano that repeat according to a visible pattern, whilst there are 104 keys on any standard keyboard.  Having said that, I completely buy the thinking behind the weighted keys argument, that&#8217;s great stuff.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also USB, so anyone wanting to use one with an <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/macmini/">Apple Mac mini</a> is in luck. But then, it&#8217;s black. Not to be racist or anything, but black just doesn&#8217;t go with shiny white Apple gear.</p>
<p>Soooo&#8230; $US79.95 plus an airfare (they don&#8217;t ship to Australia, so I&#8217;ll have to ship to them!)&#8230; hmm. Tempting, but strangely not, at the same time.</p>
