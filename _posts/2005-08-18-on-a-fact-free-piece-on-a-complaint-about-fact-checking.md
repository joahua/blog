Whilst [speaking of journalists who don&#8217;t bother to check their facts][1], the SMH&#8217;s [Razor blog][2] seems to be a tad keen on drawing a distinction between &#8220;bloggers&#8221; and &#8220;real&#8221; journalists. You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d be careful to not alienate their audience (presumably mostly geeks) in this way, but apparently not: the Big Media agenda seems to have come through rather clearly, as fact-checking standards for SMH weblogs are (one would hope &#8212; but [possibly not][3]) rather less strict than their &#8216;real&#8217; journalism.

Robert Scoble&#8217;s cell phone number has been in the side column of his blog for ages. This wouldn&#8217;t be such a big deal if your blog post &#8212; I daren&#8217;t call it an &#8216;article&#8217; or anything else that comes closer to &#8216;journalism&#8217;, lest they take offense &#8212; wasn&#8217;t speaking on the subject of lack-of-fact checking. Caught out by irony, it seems.
