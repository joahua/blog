In today&#8217;s paper, an article entitled &#8220;[Wages crack the $1000 barrier][1]&#8220;, came this spot of genius.

> A pay packet of $1000 a week is no longer anything to brag about.
> 
> Full-time adult ordinary-time earnings &#8211; the benchmark for Australia&#8217;s average wage &#8211; rose to $1008.10 a week in the three months to May 31, or $52,432 a year, the Bureau of Statistics announced yesterday.
> 
> Full-time women workers are yet to reach the new pay landmark, averaging $906 a week compared with men on $1064.

Right, so, I&#8217;m throwing in a disclaimer here. I don&#8217;t do maths as a subject, and haven&#8217;t for a while. But I think I know how to average two numbers &#8212; correct me if I&#8217;m wrong. It goes something like &#8220;add them together, and divide by two&#8221;.

Women earn $906, men earn $1064. That adds to be $1970. We&#8217;re already guessing it&#8217;s wrong, because it&#8217;s impossible to get 10 cents from that. But hey, I&#8217;ll do the sum anyway: it&#8217;s $985. And no cents.

It seems there&#8217;s more than a few workers of dubious gender in Australia&#8230;

<ins>Ah, it appears <a href="/blog/2005/08/19/picking-on-the-smh-some-more#comment-4406">Nick has discovered where I went wrong</a>. The ten cents thing did seem a little too&#8230; odd&#8230; to be straight out incorrect!</ins>
