*[Abbreviated Human][1]* (PDF, 157.3KB) was submitted today. The PDF uses Type 1 fonts, and is hence best viewed on paper, but Acrobat Reader does a fairly good job of rendering it nicely on screen. My recommendation to the reader is to click &#8220;View&#8221; then &#8220;Page Layout&#8221; then select &#8220;Continuous &#8212; Facing&#8221; in Acrobat Reader, if your screen is sufficiently wide.

Further, if you want to print it, the best way to do this is as a double-sided document, as the page margins alternate slightly to accomodate for this.

The work is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs License][2]. Whilst the license permits reproduction for non-commerical purposes, I would personally prefer this did not occur extensively. A plain <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> version may be forthcoming at some point in the future.

Comments on this post are disabled for a reason &#8212; attempts to comment elsewhere will be deleted. I&#8217;m publishing this work, not seeking feedback. That stage has passed.

I&#8217;m using the Internet here as a unidirectional medium because this work was never crafted as hypertext, never meant to be part of an inter-related web of data relationships, and has been transposed into this form incidentally. I&#8217;m sharing this work, but not wishing for extrapolation. Read what you will from it alone. I hope it is powerful and lucid enough to be appreciated as a piece of art, but I don&#8217;t wish to receive feedback on it, be that criticism or praise. The work&#8217;s purpose was never that, and I hope it achieves something greater than mere acknowledgement or a number on a sheet of paper in a few months time.
