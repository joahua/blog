This is the end of a movie. It&#8217;s the moment you feel as though you want to cry, but don&#8217;t, because the credits begin to roll and the lights begin to fade up and you realise you&#8217;re just sitting in a cinema, probably with friends, and any semblance of emotion is stolen away by that dull surface some meters in front of you. Life resumes, in ten minutes you have exited the theatre and probably moved on to other things.

Lest we forget. I don&#8217;t want to.
