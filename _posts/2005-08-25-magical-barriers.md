Okay, so it&#8217;s not exactly 1GB. It&#8217;s about 14MB shy. But I&#8217;ll make that usage up before tomorrow, and I wanted to post now!

I&#8217;ve cracked the 1000MB/month barrier for the first time, and it&#8217;s only the 25<sup>th</sup>. This month has also seen a new high in unique visitors, impressions, and numbers of pages served. In fact, it&#8217;s been a record month in most, if not all, web-related respects.

Not content, though. I need to post some more to break records *there*!
