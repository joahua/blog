Tori and I attended [Sydney University Live!][2] (marketing-speak for &#8220;an open day&#8221;) today, and were bemused to hear how some lecturers fondly referred to their use of technology, citing in particular a product known as &#8220;[Blackboard][3]&#8220;. It seems everything old is new again &#8212; or, to cite Richard Glover, &#8220;[They&#8217;ve reinvented the wheel &#8211; and now (gasp) it&#8217;s got corners.][4]&#8221;

<ins>Later: Oh, and to preempt any criticism of Richard&#8217;s article, I&#8217;d suggest listening to ThePodcastNetwork&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com/gday_world/2005/07/04/on-the-pod-37-richard-glover/">interview with him</a> some time after it was published. To me at least, Richard seems well reasoned and fair, whilst TPN&#8217;s Cameron Reilly is clearly pursuing an agenda and aims to attack Richard on the basis of his vocation as a <em>professional</em> radio host.</ins>
