Well, they still haven&#8217;t cottoned onto the sematic web thing (perhaps because they&#8217;re not trying to get indexed by anyone else!), but Australian engines keep popping up. Of late, we&#8217;ve seen an aggressive marketing campaign from Telstra-owned Sensis Group, both for their own general purpose search engine, [Sensis.com.au][1], and for their subsidiary [Yellow Pages][2] directory.

In fact, so prolific is this campaign that the two often collide in spectacular style, as I discovered on my (prolonged, courtesy of the Cross City Tunnel stupidity that gripped Sydney today) bus trip into the city this morning.

It wouldn&#8217;t have been so tragic if their campaigns weren&#8217;t so similar&#8230; but they are. The only difference, apparently, is the strength of execution: note the SMS components of each campaign vary slightly, with Sensis using a regular number (presumably to add unsuspecting commuters email addresses *and* phone numbers to a database for on-selling) whilst the Yellow Pages have at least gone to the trouble of acquiring a dedicated promotional number.

As a side note, their index is heavily commercially geared, and seems to leverage &#8220;Australian&#8221; results purely on the basis of domain namespace (that is, .au). As a developer, I&#8217;m not terribly impressed with it, but, [unlike Ansearch][5], this is a force that may have to be taken seriously into consideration in the months and years to come.
