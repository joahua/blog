As part of [Opera&#8217;s][1] 10<sup>th</sup> birthday celebrations, they&#8217;re giving away (for today only) [free registration codes][2] to remove the advertising from their browser. I imagine this will only work for the present version, and when a new version comes out people will be hooked, and either put up with the advertising or buy the real product: either way, they make their money.

It&#8217;s a brilliant move, and a great way to celebrate 10 years!
