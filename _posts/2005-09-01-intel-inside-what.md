I&#8217;m fairly indifferent to the whole Intel-bashing thing, but couldn&#8217;t help taking this photo today.

Actually, I didn&#8217;t go looking in the bin: there may well have been a stray processor in there.  
On another note, that&#8217;s probably the biggest Intel Inside sticker I&#8217;ve seen (that wasn&#8217;t part of a greater display, etc.).
