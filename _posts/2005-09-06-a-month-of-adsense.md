It&#8217;s been a month since I added Google ads to this site tomorrow, and I&#8217;ve raised just enough money to pay for a domain name for a year. As viewers of this website, do you think it&#8217;s worth keeping around? I&#8217;ll be watching this post&#8217;s comments closely.

Oh, and on a related note, <acronym title="Real Simple Syndication, or Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feed-only users need not apply/comment! ;)
