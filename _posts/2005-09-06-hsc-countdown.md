Observant users<sup id="6sep05base1"><a href="#6sep05fn1">\*</a></sup> will note a &#8220;HSC countdown&#8221; clock towards the right edge of your screen. It&#8217;s timed to countdown to the start of the first exam: 9.20am on October 17, 2005.

Okay, I admit it. This is a shameless procrastination attempt. But now you know how long I have to procrastinate for, so feel sorry for me (and every other year 12 student in NSW). Or something.

Oh, and, as with several things on this website, I&#8217;m perfectly aware it displays kind of on top of some text in Internet Explorer. I don&#8217;t particularly care. If it annoys you, then using a [better][1] [web][2] [browser][3] will not only fix that problem, but also reduce the probability of spyware, viruses, and other miscellaneous nasties from installing on your computer. As a bonus, you also get nifty things such as tabbed browsing, etc.
