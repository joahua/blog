So I dropped a none-too-flattering allusion to [Ansearch][1] into [a post about the search engine industry in Australia][2] a bit over a week ago now, and their CEO Dean Jones [popped in][3] to say he&#8217;d picked up the post via [Technorati][4] (I was suitably impressed) and that much had changed since [my first &#8220;review&#8221;][5].

I took up his invitation to contact him via email with questions and suggestions, but have yet to hear anything back. This is perhaps understandable given the length of the email: but I did at least expect a reply acknowledging receipt of this message. At any rate, at present any opportunity Ansearch may have had to clarify misconceptions presented here hasn&#8217;t been taken up. I communicated in the email that I was more than happy to publish not only his responses to explicit questions, but also &#8220;anything else you wish to add that I haven&#8217;t asked about&#8221;.

If anyone from Ansearch picks up *this* post via Technorati, the offer remains open. If you&#8217;d prefer not to use email, I&#8217;m happy to do a telephone interview for publication here (both in article form and as a supplementary transcript/podcast).

<ins><strong>Update:</strong> Dean Jones picked up the post, and sent me an email saying he&#8217;ll reply shortly. Watch this space!</ins>
