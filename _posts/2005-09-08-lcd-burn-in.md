I&#8217;ve realised today that my LCD screen is suffering from burn in.

![A photo of burn in, left, and a normal screenshot, right.][1]

Apparently, it&#8217;s actually called &#8220;image persistence&#8221;, but I think that&#8217;s more corporate double-speak than anything else. The [solution][2]? Leave your screen turned off for long enough, or use up more lamp hours (and hence have to replace it sooner anyway) displaying a blank white image.

Just in time for the HSC! :D
