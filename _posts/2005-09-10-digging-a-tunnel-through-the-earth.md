Wow. This Google Maps stupidity has to reach its peak soon! Found this one via [CNet News.com][1]: [If I dig a very deep hole, where I go to stop?][2] [sic]

Sydney-ites end up in the Atlantic somewhere. New Zealanders land just on the far western edge of Europe! (More specifically, roughly where Christchurch is hits roughly the Northern border of Spain).

Proudly brought to you with 36 days remaining until the HSC!
