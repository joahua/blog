So I was looking for some light reading on the Ruby language, just because [it [or the Rails framework that builds on it] seems cool][1] and shortly before the biggest exams I&#8217;ve ever done commence is always a great time to acquire new and completely irrelevant skills (but, be assured &#8212; or disappointed &#8212; to know, I&#8217;m saving learning a language until afterwards!).

In my searching, I stumbled across a Creative Commons licensed work, entitled [Why&#8217;s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby][3]. It&#8217;s a work of moderate genius and&#8230; well&#8230; poignancy. Tis most poignant indeed. On a scale of one to poignant, it&#8217;s&#8230; towards poignant.

If you&#8217;re looking to learn something about Ruby and don&#8217;t mind occasional, rather amusing, diversions, I&#8217;d say (at twelve pages into the PDF version) it&#8217;s well worth a read.
