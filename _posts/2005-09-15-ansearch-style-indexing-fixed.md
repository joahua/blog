I&#8217;ve been advised that Ansearch&#8217;s style indexing bug has been ironed out, and will wash out as the next round of indexing comes into service. Chances are this hasn&#8217;t really affected anyone, as it&#8217;s unlikely a substantial number of the top 500,000 sites according to Ansearch&#8217;s statistics would have firstly picked up on it, and secondly bothered to do something meaningful about it.

But hey, it&#8217;s still nice to know, right?
