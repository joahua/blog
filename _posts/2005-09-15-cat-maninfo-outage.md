As a result of trying to transfer a domain between registrars in not-quite-enough time, Ben&#8217;s domain dropped off the map. Hopefully, when it&#8217;s released back onto the market next month, we&#8217;ll be able to grab it again &#8212; but, until then, you can get to his site (which, you know, hasn&#8217;t been updated for ages! Update your site, Ben!) at [cat-man.joahua.com][1] or simply via [cat-man.homeip.net][2].

The DNS change should have propagated most places now &#8212; cat-man.homeip.net will definitely be working, even if cat-man.joahua.com isn&#8217;t yet.
