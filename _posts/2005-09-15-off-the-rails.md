<pre>josh@joah:~/Desktop/test$ rails Test      

    Rails requires Ruby version 1.8.2 (2004-12-25) or later.
    You're running 1.8.2 (2004-12-23); please upgrade to continue.

josh@joah:~/Desktop/test$ ruby -v
ruby 1.8.2 (2004-12-23) [i386-linux]</pre>

I am indeed running a build released two days prior. The version number is the same. What gives?
