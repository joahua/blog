[Beyonce, Becks and me me me &#8211; smh.com.au][1]

Just a quick link. I&#8217;d love it if the newspaper actually provided links to the various papers mentioned. I&#8217;m no huge fan of the &#8220;celebrity as an object of study&#8221; thing, but snippets of this article stir [my] interest.

The only parts of any value to me in this article are in relation to the connection between media focus and our society &#8212; surmised in two short quotations from the piece:

> Explaining how Beckham&#8217;s career has been littered with Christian symbolism, Brick said redemption, resurrection, and salvation &#8220;are the narratives that tell his story&#8221;. The footballer&#8217;s perception of himself seems to concur: he has appeared in magazines adopting a Christ-like pose, has a crucifix tattoo and named one of his sons Cruz, Spanish for cross.
> 
> But Brick&#8217;s paper said reading Beckham as postmodern religious icon, a new god of the global consumer culture, was insufficient. &#8220;Rather, Beckham&#8217;s celebrity speaks to the paradoxical desire to attribute meaning in a culture which is increasingly defined as meaningless&#8230;&#8221;

> Paul McDonald, from Roehampton University in England, pointed out that at the start of last century, press profiles concentrated on political, business and religious leaders, &#8220;yet by the 1920s, the focus of that attention had shifted toward coverage of figures in entertainment or sports&#8221;. The media&#8217;s attention had moved from the idols of production towards idols of consumption.

Still, it&#8217;s worth reading the whole article to contextualise those snippets.
