When the whole web goes crazy, and spammers send completely random characters down the line to completely random addresses, their aim now it seems moved beyond even any idealism of making money and simply into the abstract realm of &#8220;How much do you reckon we can piss these people off?&#8221; Finally, professional spammers and teenaged crackers have realised their lives *are* utterly meaningless, and that their stereotypically poor self-esteem is entirely deserved. You people are the scum of the planet.

Email, however, is not enough. You pump drivel down [our][1] [contact][2] [forms][3], down every channel of communication, in the vain hope that someone will listen to your inane messages. Or, alternatively, not even to that: just that someone will read the random characters your program has generated. Congratulations, you&#8217;re a tool. You took a medium designed for communication, and reduced it to nothing. This isn&#8217;t communication, this is transfer. Of nothing. This is the realisation of the world of Lea, only worse. You aren&#8217;t even abbreviated humans: you can&#8217;t even pretend you have a language. You don&#8217;t even have that. Only your characters, lacking syntax, form, meaning. Not even in the sense of an abstract poetic idealism: just words. You don&#8217;t even have that.

We&#8217;ve watched from afar as you have spiralled to your death. As slowly, your attempts to evade detection have slowly fallen in purpose. From well written, but ill-founded, communications, you have regressed &#8212; your language loses regularity of form, anything to evade detection. [Collective action][4] has seen the demise of a medium, spiralling into nothing. You brought about this demise. Your own perception of what is and isn&#8217;t successful. You are, even now, destroying your own [messed up] livelihood.

Go back to being introverted geeks. Have no contact with anyone: we&#8217;d prefer it like that. Stay that way, or rot in the backwaters of the Internet: your own cess pool of meaningless characters.
