[ArtsEdge][1] is a seriously impressive website. Go there, check out the design (stunning, clear), then look at the technical aspects of it &#8212; this is the most surprising part. Semantically brilliant markup, even if a little div-heavy, and 100% CSS styling. This is the kind of website that print graphics agencies strive for &#8211; only, more often than not, they&#8217;re stuck in a fixed-pixel mindset which means no fluid design elements like on this site (e.g. the orange &#8220;lick&#8221; at the bottom and core content area background element, which displays in full at 1024+ and doesn&#8217;t visibly have anything missing at 800&#215;600 or less). Its print stylesheet is also good stuff, trimming everything but the content and core branding itself &#8212; not enough websites do that.

As is too often the case with web companies, the agency responsible for this site, [Cube7][2], don&#8217;t appear to have had the chance to give their own website this treatment yet. Even so, it&#8217;s a great testament to both their capabilities and the design potential of CSS.
