Yes, I haven&#8217;t been posting as much in the last few days. Between the end of school, the revue, a valedictory service, the formal (and briefly, the afterparty), and [setting up a website to house content from all of the above][1], I haven&#8217;t had massive amounts of spare time.

Despite all that, I have no intention of posting about it all here. I figure the various photos say enough&#8230;
