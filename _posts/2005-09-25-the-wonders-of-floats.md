I know this has been done before, but I haven&#8217;t personally tried making a layout that works like this. Actually, it&#8217;s not even quite a layout. Just [a well presented list of thumbnails][1].

You&#8217;ll note that the layout looks, at first glance, suspiciously as though it were done in a table. It&#8217;s not. Pure list there. Want to see something cool? Resize your window and watch as &#8220;columns&#8221; appear to add and disappear depending on how much space you&#8217;ve got. Haven&#8217;t got a massive screen? Firefox users can hold down control and spin their mouse wheel and watch the columns change before their eyes!

Ah, the many magical powers of CSS.
