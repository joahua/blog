Seriously. It&#8217;s crap. And I have no idea why! Does anyone have an explanation? Opera and IE manage relatively well&#8230; and Safari, being an Apple app, would probably perform in a manner typical of that company&#8217;s products in the print field, but Firefox screws up margins, text spacing, links, and all manner of other things. It&#8217;s just *broken*!

I&#8217;ve had problems with Windows versions of Firefox as well, so don&#8217;t try and tell me it&#8217;s just Linux (though that may be a part of it). Any ideas/links to Bugzilla?
