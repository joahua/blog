So I hadn&#8217;t upgraded until a few days ago, when [trying to solve a problem someone was having with CurlyEnc][1]. The main reason was that I was simply lazy, and that it was trivial to plug the security flaws addressed by the [1.5.2 update][2] (which seemed inconsequential in terms of actual features mentioned on the WordPress development weblog). However, there&#8217;s one minor feature change to WordPress in this release that&#8217;s important in my eyes, to the way RSS feeds are built.

At long last the comment feed item title includes the name of the post people are commenting on! This makes things infinitely more sensible, and I&#8217;m no longer reduced to hovering my mouse over the URL in order to see the link stub to determine who is commenting on what. Good stuff.
