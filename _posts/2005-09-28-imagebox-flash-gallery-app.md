I stumbled across [this post on RMW Web Publishing&#8217;s blog][1] today, and it struck me the app they mentioned could be useful for doing this whole [CD/DVD thing][2] for the [year 12 photo website][3].

The [purveyor&#8217;s website][4] is horribly Flash encumbered (i.e. I&#8217;d have never found it if I were looking for it in a search engine &#8212; I actually temporarily lost the developer&#8217;s URL for a bit there, and had to trawl through my browsing history to find it again!), but [the app itself][5] is rather useful if you&#8217;re looking for a run-from-the-desktop gallery kinda thing. My only qualm is the difficulty of generating metadata for it to do interesting stuff with, but a quick spot of shell scripting should see that problem met, hopefully. (Or even just nagging Ben until he hacks support for this gizmo into Cat-scan natively&#8230; wink wink? :P) This is the kind of app that&#8217;s a prime candidate for XML application, not in the least because of Flash&#8217;s reputedly excellent support for that kind of stuff&#8230; but it uses boring and rather confusing (mostly because I don&#8217;t speak German so a few words are odd) flat files instead. With that one caveat, it&#8217;s an otherwise helpful application. Just don&#8217;t make the mistake of [confusing applications with websites][6].
