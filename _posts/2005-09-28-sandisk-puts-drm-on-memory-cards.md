[SanDisk puts DRM on memory cards (CNet News.com)][1]

And I give it two weeks after going to market until it&#8217;s cracked. Plus it&#8217;s hardly as though it takes particulary advanced technology to manually circumvent copy controls: whilst we&#8217;ve still got analogue I/O for our digital devices, it&#8217;s perfectly possible to circumvent pretty much any DRM technology out there, cracking efforts aside. Got a line-in on your soundcard? Got a TV tuner with S-Video or Composite input? There&#8217;s your home piracy studio.

And if *we* can do it, the only people you&#8217;re fooling when you say it&#8217;s not possible are your investors: the professional pirates are yards ahead of you.

(Gosh this post makes me sound like a raving Marxist, doesn&#8217;t it?)

Anyway, the point is DRM is only ever going to succeed in a limited capacity. Then, <del>the masses will revolt and overthrow the bourgeoisie oppressors and their control of a false commodity! Socialist order will rule!!</del> erm. Then, circumvention will become the norm, rather than a temporary force. Innovation will be out-innovated. Until DRM is at the point where hardware is in some kind of stasis, and software can be updated at the whim of content purveyors. I don&#8217;t say creators, because content&#8217;s creators aren&#8217;t generally the ones heavily pushing the agenda we&#8217;re seeing from various recording lobbies &#8212; and also because I *do* find myself agreeing that the ownership of ideas is a fundamentally flawed concept.

Aside: I think this fits without difficulty into my political views &#8212; Liberalism follows the principle of government/legislative intervention only where this is seen to be of greater benefit (e.g. where there is no privately operated/owned alternative to state-owned/operated infrastructure/services)&#8230; and the notion that individuals rather than the state be creators of wealth is fairly irrelevant here, because there&#8217;s no defined *need* in liberalism for the creation of wealth in all spheres, plus the present intellectual property climate that we see exists *because of* legislative (read: government) intervention in matters best left to free market forces. I&#8217;ll stop myself from launching into a full-scale rant here&#8230; hopefully some other time.

So, I think SanDisk are digging themselves a hole. Rant over.
