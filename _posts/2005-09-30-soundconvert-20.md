I posted several months ago on [converting ACT files recorded on an MP3 player][1] to something readable on a computer. It&#8217;s probably without competition the most-read and commented-on post on this site: there are many people out there who are looking for a tool to do this. And it seems that the ACT files generated by newer MP3 player devices aren&#8217;t compatible with the older convertors.

So, one of the readers, [Phil &#8220;Mumbles&#8221;][2], discovered a tool that works for this stuff. He&#8217;s sent me the file after having cut it down from 8MB for a few apps to under 300KB for the just new sound convertor tool.

You can [download it here][3] &#8212; please post if it works or doesn&#8217;t work with your MP3 player/recorder so that other people looking for information on their device can find it.

One closing note from Phil:
