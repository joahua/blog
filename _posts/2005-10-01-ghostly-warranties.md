A few weeks ago I [posted about the image persistence problems][1] that I was having with my Polyview V372 monitor. Well, [Michael][2] called me a few days ago and said that he had some friends who&#8217;d had similar problems with low-latency LCD panels (mine is 8ms), not of any particular brand, and that they&#8217;d successfully had them replaced.

Turns out Polyview&#8217;s Australian distributor, [Protac][3], are replacing the panel for me. Even cooler is it&#8217;s an onsite warranty, so I don&#8217;t even need to leave the house. Good stuff! Anyway, they pick it up Tuesday (because I called yesterday and it&#8217;s a long weekend here in Australia&#8230; or at least <acronym title="New South Wales">NSW</acronym>, the <acronym title="Australian Capital Territory">ACT</acronym>, and <acronym title="South Australia">SA</acronym>), and it&#8217;s meant to take up to 14 days for a replacement to come&#8230; which will hopefully knock out the desire to procrastinate somewhat, as CRT displays burn ;-)
