For [that photo website][1] at [that elusive domain name][2].

Time from the idea to a site live:
:   Six hours

Time from a live site to a *functional* site:
:   About a day

Lines of code to make it go (markup, CSS, PHP):
:   2001

Number of unique visitors:
:   309

Average number of visitors per day:
:   85

Visitors downloaded:
:   325MB/day, or 2.95GB

Overall transfers:
:   3.21GB

Number of albums:
:   26

Number of (known) contributors:
:   10

Number of photos:
:   (Probably well) over 1200 (hard to count, because of source and thumbnails being stored as they are)

Total size of site:
:   498MB

Total size of photos:
:   345MB (overhead is mostly in upload archives I haven&#8217;t deleted yet)

Shell scripts rewritten to do little things from the console that I&#8217;d taken for granted on the desktop:
:   Too many. But it made me learn something, so that&#8217;s cool.

And now for the important statistics! (Because I&#8217;m a pessimist ;-))

Number of photos that would still fit:
:   At least 4 times as many as there currently are!

Amount of extra bandwidth that could have been transferred:
:   At least 8 times as much, but we didn&#8217;t do too badly seeing as that was nine days, and the quotas are done monthly.

So&#8230; this means if you still haven&#8217;t uploaded photos, do so!

On another note, I&#8217;m thinking about implementing [that upload thing Michael blogged about][3] (or rather, linked to ;-) That doesn&#8217;t actually qualify as *posting*: you&#8217;ve still got a way to go before you redeem yourself for lack of that of late!) on the form to make life easier for people who don&#8217;t seem to be able to follow my pretty straightforward (I even made pretty screenshots!) &#8220;[How to make a ZIP file][4]&#8221; guide. Ah, technology.
