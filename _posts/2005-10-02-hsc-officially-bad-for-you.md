Oh dear. I stumbled across this web address in today&#8217;s Sydney Morning Herald: <http://www.nohsc.gov.au/>

It&#8217;s actually the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission&#8217;s (NOHSC) website, but that in itself makes the link even clearer: The HSC poses an occupational health and safety risk, as is evident even in the URL of this organisation!
