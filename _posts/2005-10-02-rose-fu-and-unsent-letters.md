Stumbled across [someone called Rose Fu&#8217;s portfolio site][1] today, and was suitably impressed by the design. Markup isn&#8217;t quite perfect, but it&#8217;s just good to see people achieving this kind of thing with CSS-based design. (Read &#8220;this kind of thing&#8221;: conventionally very sliced-and-diced table-design).

Also of interest was her very [Post Secret][2]-esque project, [Unsent Letters][3]. Sure, a lot of it is as bad as angsty Fan Fiction, but it&#8217;s an interesting idea nonetheless. I&#8217;ve only looked at it for a few moments, but it seems to be generally much worse than Post Secret is (in terms of the angsty teenager thing). The submission instructions say you don&#8217;t have to be concise, and I think that might have been its demise &#8212; part of Post Secret&#8217;s beauty is it&#8217;s such a concise medium (sure, it&#8217;s visual), and allows some degree of obfuscation whilst still sharing experience or thought. But hey, it&#8217;s a different tool, and it&#8217;s possibly helpful for people to write to&#8230; I just think the fact that it&#8217;s *published* is somewhat self-defeating, because the whole thing really doesn&#8217;t seem as though it&#8217;s meant to be *read*. Which I suppose fits with the whole Unsent Letter thing, but it&#8217;s not really as though it need be published, either. Shrug. [Reach Out!][4] has a similar facility, that simply destroys what you submit. Conversly, I think that seems *very* futile&#8230;

I think Post Secret hits a nice middle ground, that&#8217;s concise (hence accessible) and creative (hence cathartic). Anyway&#8230; a post about a nice website transformed itself, weird.
