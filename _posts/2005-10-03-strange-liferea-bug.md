[Liferea][1], my feedreader of choice, has a rather odd bug invoked by the scroll wheel. If I hover over the pane resizing widget between the list of items and current item display and scroll down, the entire right pane disappears. Scrolling back up returns it to normal view, but it seems a little odd.

I&#8217;m not entirely sure where I&#8217;m scrolling *to*, either&#8230; I&#8217;m half expecting the next feed item to appear, or something, but it just goes to blank UI chrome. Most odd.

<ins>Update: Turns out it&#8217;s been fixed already, I&#8217;m just having the problem because my version is oldish (as a result of me using Ubuntu&#8217;s package repository/apt system).</ins>
