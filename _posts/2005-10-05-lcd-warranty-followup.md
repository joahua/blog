They said it was faulty. A new one arrives tomorrow. I&#8217;m expecting similar problems in about six months time based on Michael&#8217;s advice this malady afflicts many 8ms monitors, but hey, I&#8217;m happy with the fast turnaround right now. And six months time might be <del>excuse</del> occasion enough for a new screen, anyway. (Notably, I&#8217;ve never had any residual image/burn-in/&#8221;image persistance&#8221; problems with [our slightly-older 19&#8243; Benq][1]. As a byproduct of its vintage, it&#8217;s a 25ms display and is hence less susceptible to such problems.)

Now I need to find room on my desk to put the monitor back again!
