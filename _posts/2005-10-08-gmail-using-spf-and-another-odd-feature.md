I logged into my GMail account today and noticed that a message from a Yahoo! user account was authenticated using SPF, or Sender Policy Framework, and was marked as such when you click &#8220;More options&#8221;. They&#8217;ve probably been doing this for a while, but I only just realised.

Another thing they&#8217;ve got going is user aliasing&#8230; for example, I signed up for &#8220;josh.street&#8221; and received an email to JoshStreet (and since email addresses are effectively lowercase, that means joshstreet). Obviously I&#8217;m not posting my email address in parsable format (because spammers have programs to harvest email addresses off websites), but the domain is gmail.com, so that&#8217;s not too hard to figure out if you want to send me email now is it?
