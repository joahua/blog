Just finished hacking together bits of [the rejuvenated gallery][1]. I&#8217;ve ditched Photostack, finally, because it had a few too many quirks and also because I nagged [Ben][2] enough to get all the features it had into cat-scan. Resultingly, it&#8217;s now powered by that.

Permalinks will still work thanks to .htaccess magic, but feeds won&#8217;t (yet). The only new content up there is a Godspell photo album from earlier this year that I didn&#8217;t get to scan until a month or two ago.

More to come soon (including working RSS and Atom feeds), but I need to get to bed, so not tonight. Enjoy.
