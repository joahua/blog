I mean, they really employ geeks. One of their IE staffers, Dave Massy, had a baby (well, I presume his significant other did) and posted about it [amidst announcing the release of the IE Developers toolbar][1]. Notably, the baby reference was fleetingly thrown in there whilst, of course, the focus was on the birth of the toolbar!

Yeah yeah, I know, it&#8217;s an MSDN blog not a personal one, but still. Struck me as a little&#8230; odd. You&#8217;ve just had a baby! Be excited about that, not a piece of software! ;-)
