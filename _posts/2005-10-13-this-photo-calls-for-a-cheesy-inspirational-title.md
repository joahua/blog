<p>One of several shots from a series of photos I took recently. Comment and post your cheesy titles if you&#8217;re that way inclined! &#8220;Soar&#8221;, obviously, is a little too clichÃ©&#8230; can we do better? Hehehe.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/cat-scan/photo/image/sunrisecoogee280905/">the newly resurrected gallery</a>. Click the image above for (compressed) source resolution. Uncompressed source and full resolution versions of all images in the gallery are sitting on my computer&#8230; I&#8217;d say to get in touch if you want to use them for anything, but then, I still haven&#8217;t bothered to fix my contact form yet. Well, leave a comment and I&#8217;ll get in touch ;-) And I&#8217;ll fix the contact form soon, promise.</p>
