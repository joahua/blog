At this stage, if you&#8217;ve got broadband, you&#8217;d be mad trying to apt to the latest version with the core servers. I was getting maybe 14KB/second max speed from there.

Use a mirror &#8212; I&#8217;m getting about half a MB/second from mirror.isp.net.au by FTP.

Alternatively, waiting 48 hours would probably do a lot to make the experience less painful, but my theory is I don&#8217;t need to think about it whilst it&#8217;s downloading, and I have to do it at some point anyway, and they&#8217;re going to use the upstream bandwidth at some point regardless.

Interestingly, this release features OpenOffice 2.0 beta 2. The full version release was scheduled for today, but it&#8217;s now anticipated to come out sometime next week. I can understand Ubuntu/Canonical&#8217;s wish to get it in, though, seeing as they don&#8217;t change the CD images after a release goes ahead, and from all reports even OO.org 2.0 beta is a million times better than 1.0.x. Thank goodness.

Looking forward to having a play with this once it&#8217;s done downloading. <del>Because of the weird way Synaptic&#8217;s sources.list manager works, I&#8217;m now stuck downloading some packages from archive.ubuntu.com. Next time I&#8217;ll go the command-line route. Bleh, I&#8217;ll check back in a few hours.</del>

<ins>Or not. I got sick of waiting so I manually changed all the slow sources and started again. Estimated time just went down from 12 hours to 30 minutes, ooohhh yeah!</ins>
