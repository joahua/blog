Aaaannnndddd it&#8217;s screwed. I got home from a BBQ with friends from church at about 10 last night and switched my desktop [joah/home.joahua.com] on to be greeted with an X.org error screen. Fun fun. Linux sure knows how to ruin an otherwise-good evening.

Ah well, I&#8217;d already made one whole system migration sans any difficulty, with only a reboot to consider, so I&#8217;m pretty happy with the mileage I&#8217;ve got out of it thus far. Just think, if I&#8217;d tried that with a Windows system, well&#8230; it would have had maybe a month to live!

I tried to get X.org working again this morning, but NVidia&#8217;s Linux 7667 driver is being a bitch (and 7676 is worse) with my kernel sources, so I think I&#8217;ll just grab the ISOs and reinstall from scratch. I keep my home directory on a physically separate disc, so it&#8217;ll be relatively painless&#8230; but I think I&#8217;ll hold off a few days, probably until Thursday (and then, English Advanced is over *forever*!! Or, [maybe not forever][1].), so there&#8217;s one less distraction.

Now, if I start downloading the ISOs from Ubuntu&#8217;s core server today, they should be ready just in time for installation on Thursday! Heh. Mind you, that&#8217;s probably not a great idea seeing as we had a blackout yesterday (local distro snafu, nothing major, but it has me recognising blackouts as a reality now: that was the first we&#8217;ve had for&#8230; a few years, local circuit breakers/RCDs excepted. Power in the eastern suburbs is pretty good.)&#8230; I&#8217;d rather wait until the memory of that fades before leaving stuff on for extended periods of time. Really should spend a bit of money on surge protected powerboards.
