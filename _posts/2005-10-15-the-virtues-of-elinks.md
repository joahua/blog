I had written a post praising Elinks&#8217; capabilities, featuring not only HTTPS and FTP support, but also tabbed browsing and more-than-respectable rendering of table-based pages &#8212; heck, it even works *well* with Gmail, albeit in plain HTML mode. But then I accidentally hit the wrong arrow key. And it ate my post. So now I feel less like saying nice things about it than before.

Nevertheless, impressive considering the limitations of the medium. I used it to download Breezy from iiNet&#8217;s FTP (because ISP.net.au still doesn&#8217;t have the ISOs), and averaged about 750KB/s &#8212; which is about a third again of what I was getting from ISP.net.au, so I think I&#8217;ll change the sources.list to that. It&#8217;s a shame Telstra&#8217;s files.bigpond.com is so useless/HTTP-only/slow to respond to new releases, because I&#8217;d love &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d save some bandwidth/peering expenditure &#8212; to be able to get quota-free downloads of this stuff. I probably *could* have got Breezy from there, albeit via HTTP, albeit in a few days time whenever they get stuff up there (haven&#8217;t checked, might be there already, but generally they&#8217;re pretty sluggish), but it&#8217;s just so much easier this way.

Anyway, I&#8217;ve burnt it to CD now (no, Elinks doesn&#8217;t do that too) and will hopefully be up and running again soon.
