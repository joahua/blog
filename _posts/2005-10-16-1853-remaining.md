Note to self, PHP&#8217;s mktime() function breaks when you use leading zeros. Thankfully, that means I&#8217;ve got 18 hours left to cram, and not nine. Bizarre.

p.s. Now&#8217;s a good time for the RSS people to come out from the trees and look at the now fixed hh:mm countdown on my site.  
p.p.s. The first post-script will be irrelevant this time tomorrow.  
p.p.p.s. Trackback spammers, have a heart. I haven&#8217;t got time to deal with your crap right now, and really won&#8217;t feel like it tomorrow afternoon. Just go away for a while, okay? Thanks.
