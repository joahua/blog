Someone remind me next time I say I&#8217;m going to do something stupid like reinstall an operating system too quickly, that databases aren&#8217;t stored in my home directory. Far out. I&#8217;ve just created hours of work for myself trying to piece together what used to be in various MySQL databases on this computer. Yeah, I know, I should backup, but seeing as I never make major changes (it&#8217;s all just incremental little stuff for sites still in the development phase) and really don&#8217;t understand how things are *meant* to be backed up with MySQL (do you export queries, or do you copy the folder, huh? HUH!??) I don&#8217;t anywhere near as often as I should.

For me, the databases are generally ancillary things that are merely there to fill in spaces in CSS-based designs, so I always backup design aspects, but rarely the database itself, because there&#8217;s no original content there. Well, yeah, but there&#8217;s vitally important *structure* that&#8217;s just been thrown away. Doh!

Oh well, nothing I can (read: should) do about it now, maybe between tomorrow afternoon and Thursday. Think of it as post-humous ITF study. Because that&#8217;s all it&#8217;s going to get.
