Hopefully it&#8217;ll come back if I disable integration between the two. Possibly. If not, it&#8217;s been needing a prune for a while and I might just start from scratch rather than restore backups (incidentally, Evolution makes it impossibly hard to backup your contacts list, and it&#8217;s in a closed format. Far out. It seriously sucks at that whole thing.)

Will work it out sometime tomorrow.
