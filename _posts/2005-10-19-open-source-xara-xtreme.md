[Open Source Xara Xtreme][1]

Someone alluded to this on a mailing list I&#8217;m a member of (Roy Schestowitz, on lyx-users), and, being the day before an exam and all, I couldn&#8217;t help but check it out. I remember playing with Xara tools back in the day of bundled garbage on computer magazine CDs (that was also my first brush with a full version of Flash, at version 3, but that&#8217;s another story. I&#8217;d played with FutureSplash sometime before then, too.) &#8212; it looks as though it&#8217;s come a long way.

I&#8217;ve used Sodipodi on Linux to do some useful things, but haven&#8217;t had a chance to play around with Inkscape yet&#8230; though it looks similar, maybe even a fork? Definitely on the to-do list. Anyway, the folks at Xara want people to spread the word they&#8217;ve got a cool GPL&#8217;d app coming for the Linux desktop (Mac OS too), and I think it&#8217;s a great thing for the Open Source community, which is why I&#8217;m pimping it here.

There&#8217;s a version on their [xaraxtreme.org][2] site that is functional already, though it only views files at present&#8230; editing functionality is&#8230; presumably some way off.

I think if someone offered Pantone swatches for sale with a good quality open-source app, I&#8217;d go for it. Their business model seems solid enough after they&#8217;ve got it off the ground, but only time will tell. One hopes they stay around, because this appears to be a far better contribution than Corel&#8217;s abortive attempts to launch a graphics app on the Linux desktop (closed source, of course &#8212; Photo-PAINT 9, if I recall correctly. It was a RAM-guzzling beast that I may have even enjoyed at the time &#8212; circa 2000 &#8212; had it not been for the fact that I was trying to run it on a middle-of-the-road Pentium (1) with 32MB of RAM) before their silent acquiescence was purchased by Microsoft.

If nothing else, it&#8217;ll stir up the space a little bit and hopefully the mention of open source will get otherwise-complacent Adobe innovating again in the Mac space&#8230; or, alternatively, it could go the other way and they might just ditch that platform altogether in favour of Windows, though I doubt it.
