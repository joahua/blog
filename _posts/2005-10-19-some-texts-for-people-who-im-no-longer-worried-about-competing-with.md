For English Advanced Module C, *Telling the Truth*, consider:

*   *Network* (film, 19<del>74ish?</del><ins>76</ins>)
*   *Howard Killed* (mashup track, available from [http://www.waxaudio.com.au/download\_the\_mp3s/mediacracy][1])
*   *An Enemy of the People* (play, Henrik Ibsen)
*   &#8220;[The Reality of Absolute Truth][2]&#8221; (opinion piece, *The Sydney Morning Herald*)
*   The Picture of Dorian Gray (book, Oscar Wilde &#8212; good for appearance vs. reality)

In no particular order. Some are, however, better than others. All except *Network* are available online (via their own website of publication or [Project Gutenberg][3]).

<small>Oh, and before anyone says they can get <em>Network</em> from P2P, I&#8217;ll wish you good luck. It&#8217;s available on DVD, but only just, and it&#8217;s hardly a popular film anymore. I rented it out, watched and took notes, then a few days later wanted to check something. I couldn&#8217;t find anything online, so&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t waste your time.</small>

These are all relatively/very obscure, so it&#8217;s unlikely many people will use them. Unless of course lots of people are searching for module C/telling the truth texts online and find this post. At any rate, enjoy.
