I watched [a customer profile video on Big Spaceship][1], a company doing some funky things with Macromedia&#8217;s new Flash 8, and hurried off to have a look at the [Underworld: Evolution][2] site (because of the technology, and, yes, because I&#8217;m a sucker for that kind of movie).

Alas, Flash 8 is required &#8212; and 7 is the latest available for Linux! I was loathe to walk over to another computer just for that, so I&#8217;ll have a look later I guess.
