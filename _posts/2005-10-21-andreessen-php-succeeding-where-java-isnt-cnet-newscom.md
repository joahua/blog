An [interesting article from CNet][1] reporting Marc Andreessen&#8217;s (of Netscape fame, amongst other things) comments on the future of PHP and Java. Personally, I think the whole thing is overplayed. So what, we&#8217;re seeing a diversion between where the technologies are applied? Okay&#8230; PHP has the higher level closer-to-the-browser layers, and Java does the hardcore stuff. It is, as the article suggests, a pretty complex language, and it&#8217;s being used accordingly.

At the [end of the article (second page)][2], Andreessen is quoted as saying &#8220;I think Flash is one of the most exciting technologies out there that&#8217;s almost on the verge of great success and never quite achieving it.&#8221;

What on earth is his definition of success? Flash has 97% market penetration, which is higher than any *operating system* on the planet, let alone browser or scripting language. He&#8217;s decrying the peril of Java as it shifts away from prominence on the web &#8212; and who needs Java applets, anyway? Google, if you try and get into that whole thing, damn you too. They&#8217;re slow to load, and generally crap. Newer versions are looking more and more like Flash clones, with video support leading the way in this area &#8212; to where? Why, to the systems that sit behind the web. It still fits with Sun&#8217;s infamous &#8220;the network is the computer&#8221; paradigm, albeit slightly differently.

Me, I don&#8217;t particularly care about the backend tools. I&#8217;m a frontend person. However, if we can reduce complexity of systems closer to the delivery layer, we should &#8212; if this means choosing PHP for something over Java, so be it. PHP, however, doesn&#8217;t run on the desktop (unless you&#8217;re [someone with BSD and too much time on your hands][3] ;-), and Java does. This, admittedly, is slightly apart from Sun&#8217;s proclaimed strategy &#8212; but it isn&#8217;t really such a bad place to be. The places this technology is/has a stronghold is the enterprise desktop. I can only see Java in this field moving in the direction of desktop apps as a gateway to the network, as that (so it seems to me) has always been one of the platform&#8217;s core advantages &#8212; it has great connectivity powers.

Java, for a standalone app, seems a little&#8230; lonely. It doesn&#8217;t make sense. It&#8217;s like a real compiled app, only probably more complex and slower. Once you introduce the network, it starts to make sense. I think Eclipse&#8217;s director Mike Milinkovich has a quote that surmises the article flawlessly: &#8220;Java and PHP compete at some level. Get over it.&#8221;
