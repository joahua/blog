<p>Last night we had our second &#8220;Cook Off&#8221; event, which involves a bunch of ingredients and four teams competing against each other to create something <del>delicious</del> <ins>edible</ins>.</p>
<p><a href="/photostack/photo/image/pulsecookoff/IMGP0400/"><img src="/photostack/images/pulsecookoff/IMGP0400.jpg" alt="Delicious looking chicken and pasta!" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="/photostack/photo/image/pulsecookoff/">uploaded a bunch of photos from the cook-off</a>, so&#8230; go check them out. Credits to Sarah for&#8230; about half of the shots. I did the food macro ones. Also managed to accidentally over-write source images when copying, so the scaled images you see in the album are all I&#8217;ve got, sorry.</p>
