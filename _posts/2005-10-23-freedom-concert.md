Last night at St Thomas&#8217; in North Sydney there was a concert called &#8220;[Freedom][1]&#8220;. There were two acts, being Mike McCarthy and The View (pictured below), as well as a short talk on *true* freedom through Jesus.

Geek aside: They were using a [Jands 4 PAKc][3] and two sets of 4 pars on either side of stage, and it looked as though the op managed to get them to chase in pairs (even though they were paired on the dimmer by colour on either side of stage)&#8230; as in, 2&#215;2 alternating rather than 1&#215;1 alternating across the four channels. Was most bizarre. It&#8217;s a pretty neat console for small band things and other places where there&#8217;s no [convenient] access to 32A power, plus they&#8217;re painless to setup and transport. Oh, yeah, and if all you need is a couple of pars then there&#8217;s no excuse for spending more on a console *and* dimmer: these things are sub-$800AU.
