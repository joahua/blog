I had a dream last night where my house had a kinda different layout (but the contents were the same&#8230;, and all the computers were downstairs and the front opened up some more/had really cool glass doors. There were a few people around so I left the house with someone and went for a drive [in a 4WD, go figure... was most odd], not bothering to lock the doors because I figured other people were around and were going to stay there. I don&#8217;t actually remember who any of these people were, but meh :P

Anyway, we get back about half an hour later and there&#8217;s no-one there anymore, and someone has stolen two LCD screens (but left all the old ones &#8212; I felt bad because I hadn&#8217;t packed away the 19&#8243; and 17&#8243; boxes, so that made it quicker/easier for them to take stuff), as well as my computer (but no others&#8230; there&#8217;s probably no rational reason for this, aside from that it was *my* dream. Possibly because a few days back I&#8217;d been asked what one thing I would take out of my house if it was burning down, and I said my computer because it&#8217;s got a few years worth of photos, work, and music on it &#8212; and not all of those things are completely backed up offsite.)

In actual fact, I didn&#8217;t particularly care. Insurance would pay for the screens, and having to get a new computer meant not only that I didn&#8217;t have to worry about the inevitable bloat of my home directory (and my Desktop is a living example of chaos theory &#8212; I&#8217;ll clean it up, only to find it absolutely full three days later), but also that I could get an iBook instead! Yay!

Of course, none of this actually happened. But I was pleased to realise how little I&#8217;d actually care! And, for a few short moments, I was convinced I was going to get an iBook. Then I woke up.
