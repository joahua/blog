Regretably, the location bar has been disposed of in the latest version of Nautilus, in favour of buttons to navigate to the present directory. This sucks. Especially when trying to access hidden folders quickly and easily. Today, I discovered it&#8217;s possible to use **Ctrl + L** to achieve the same thing, but I really don&#8217;t see why a series of buttons should be used to do what I could do before. In my case the buttons take more time, because I&#8217;m a keyboard person and mousing is, except for when very tired, a secondary action.

So I changed the default back to what it should have stayed as, following [these instructions I found online][1]. I say &#8220;should have stayed as&#8221; because the change introduces insurmountable barriers (e.g. navigating to hidden files/folders) to the user experience, in favour of a *very* dubious UI enhancement. Dictated not only by convention, but also practicality.

Furthering my irritation was the difficulty of changing it back. The steps described on the post I found aren&#8217;t particularly complex, but this is something that should be accessible via the **Edit &#8594; Preferences** menu within Nautilus itself: it is akin to show/hide hidden files, which is in there where it should be (also via **Ctrl + H** &#8212; but I consider this poorly implemented, too, as it requires a manual refresh of the page to restore initally-screwed up icon positioning).
