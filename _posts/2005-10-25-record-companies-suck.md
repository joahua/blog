In today&#8217;s news, [iTMS Australia][1] launches without Sony, presumably because [they&#8217;re greedy, uncompromising bastards][2]. I&#8217;d like to be sued for defamation on that comment (because, you know, they&#8217;d get awarded such massive damages for a blog this size), because then at least the real reason would come out, either way. I&#8217;m inclined to think they&#8217;re far more evil than Apple, but perhaps that&#8217;s just PR spin. Having said that, here&#8217;s evidence to the contrary from an AppleTalk Australia interview with [CD Baby][3] founder, Derek Sivers:

    Keep in mind : Apple is not screwing musicians. Labels are screwing musicians. Apple pays 70 cents per 99-cent download. If the artist has signed their music over to a label, they don&#8217;t own their music anymore. The label does. So Apple pays the label 70 cents per song, and the label pays the artist&#8230; what&#8230; a penny? Two? Nothing at all? But when an artist is NOT signed to a label, when they&#8217;re going through CD Baby for example, we only keep a 9% cut and pay 91% of all income directly to the artists every week. Our accounting is wide open so they can see every dollar every day, and it all goes to the artist every week, without fail, for over 7 years now.

Also, I&#8217;ve just discovered that iTunes users, even on Windows, can rip CDs with supposed &#8220;Copy Control&#8221; technology without even having to resort to the typical Shift key &#8220;hack&#8221; (heh, and, in the US, pressing Shift at that point in time is entirely illegal. Remove those copyright circumvention devices from your keyboards, America!!) to prevent the loading of supposed restricting technologies. I guess this means iTunes is now illegal under the DMCA, too?

For the record, the CD in question was Placebo&#8217;s 2003 &#8220;Sleeping with Ghosts&#8221; album, published by Virgin. At least they didn&#8217;t have the audacity to use the standard CD logo on it (because these copy-control things are outside of Red Book spec).
