F-Spot is a [photo management/cataloguing thing][1] from the Gnome project that looks cool. Another reason to love Gnome! Note particularly the cool timeline thing in the screenshot on their site. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll start using it yet, but it looks cool. Assuming I don&#8217;t eventually wind up on iPhoto, this is probably going to become a mainstay of my day-to-day computing life if development on it continues (and I don&#8217;t see why it wouldn&#8217;t).

Obligatory geek aside: Look, it&#8217;s written in C# [and uses Mono!][2] (yeah, I realise I&#8217;m linking to my own comment. Not just a vanity trip, it is actually relevant!)
