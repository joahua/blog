I haven&#8217;t been running much lately, because&#8230; I&#8217;m lazy. And there are exams on. And I&#8217;d much rather procrastinate passively. Or something. I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t really have any good excuses.

There is, however, something that would probably make me want to run more. [This ridiculously cool GPS training device][1]! It&#8217;s like&#8230; hey&#8230; you&#8217;re a geek. And you want to run. With gimmicks that are arguably useful. Buy me, buy me!

Somehow, though, at $US330ish plus shipping, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to happen. The solution? Start jogging with a backpack and take a car GPS unit (already have one)!

Yeah, not terribly likely, either. Ah well. Hopefully The Trip to New Zealand coming up (have I mentioned that online yet? Geez&#8230; maybe not&#8230; how bad) will serve to kinda remedy the whole lack-of-exercise situation and create a habit for when I get back. If I haven&#8217;t mentioned that on this site before (I don&#8217;t remember doing that, I don&#8217;t think I have), then&#8230; consider this notice. I&#8217;m going to NZ from **Saturday the 12<sup>th</sup> of November** until **Monday the 5<sup>th</sup> of December**. Tori leaves to go to England on November 10, so that&#8217;ll be distraction enough after finishing the exams and just before packing&#8230; and hopefully NZ will be enough of a distraction for me to not realise she&#8217;s on the other side of the planet for a while (and vice versa, I imagine&#8230;)

I&#8217;m planning on taking lots of photos, but haven&#8217;t decided which camera to take yet. Or, more accurately, how many I will take. I&#8217;m definitely planning on taking my Pentax SP500 w/ 28-70mm lens, but don&#8217;t know whether my little Pentax qualifies. I can see it either getting broken or full very quickly. Contemplating getting a harddrive-based reader thingo (something like this [HD-DM40 from Anyware][2], about $215 from a retailer), but quite uncertain. It&#8217;s just more stuff to carry in a backpack that&#8217;s already going to be substantially full.

Plus, as I&#8217;ve told some people before, I like film grain. It looks nice. Far nicer than digital compression artifacts or the sensor crapping out in low light conditions. [One of Hayley&#8217;s photos on year12.joahua.com][3] demonstrates this nicely, because it&#8217;s not a *good* photo, but it&#8217;s very *nice* and characterful&#8230; mostly, I think, because it was shot on film not digital.

So, I can live with my own inability to use a camera perfectly meaning I get a handful of blurry shots, and it costing a little more to get photos developed/make mistakes. The question is, should I have a secondary camera for quick photos that I can check the quality of immediately, just in case? I could probably drop my SP500 in water and it&#8217;d survive after a [probably quite expensive] service&#8230; I can&#8217;t say the same thing for the digital. Funnily enough, the tiny digital would ultimately take up nearly as much space as the chunky SLR, because it would mean I&#8217;d be carrying a charger for its batteries, a hard drive, and a charger for the hard drive, as well as the camera itself. I could just not use the hard drive and try to find a net cafe, but that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d rather not rely on. I could also buy another SD card or two before we leave&#8230; which is a distinct possibility, given how cheap those things are getting (I saw a 256MB card for under $30 yesterday, and wasn&#8217;t even looking. 512MB cards can be had for under $50). Problematically, they&#8217;re absolutely tiny and I can just see myself losing one.

Suggestions, anyone?
