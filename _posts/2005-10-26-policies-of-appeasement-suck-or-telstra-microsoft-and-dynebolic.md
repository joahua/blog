Both when it comes to [20<sup>th</sup> century international relations][1] and technology companies.

Ironically, I was looking for that software so I could see what could be done away from a MS Windows live production environment (for an event mid-December this year). As it stands, I&#8217;m downloading [Dyne:bolic][2] from another source (GNU.org&#8217;s US FTP server, actually. One of Bigpond&#8217;s more often-saturated links), and will post here once I&#8217;ve figured out if it&#8217;s worth &#8220;the risk&#8221; of using. And again if/when it gets used.

My biggest concern is it&#8217;s not going to like various TV-out hardware on the two computers I want to use it on. Actually, it only needs to work on one &#8212; the other is up to Ubuntu, but the software will be much the same. And yes, I now trust Ubuntu enough&#8230; kind of. Breezy is ridiculously stable, though its multimedia performance can be a bit lacklustre. I&#8217;m blaming the TNT2, though, and figure it&#8217;ll pick up lots if I stick a GeForce 6600 in it. Failing that&#8230; I&#8217;ll probably use a laptop, or something else boring.

Basically, I want the Dyne:bolic box to be a playback machine, and the Ubuntu box is just gonna sit there and feed a nice static graphic (or maybe an animated logo, if I get bored). The Ubuntu box will be my desktop, because, whilst it&#8217;s fine for WWW stuff and the spot of word-processing&#8230; I have too much crap installed on it. Contrary to popular opinion, Windows is far easier to trim services/background apps on for extra speed than Linux on the desktop is. The amount of crap Gnome/Ximian/Nautilus leaves lying around is truly disgusting if you ever want to try and stop all the processes and just have something work on its own. I could launch into a failsafe X session and just run what I want from there, I guess&#8230; always a possibility. Can&#8217;t do *that* on Windows (if someone says &#8220;safe mode&#8221; I might stab them).

If anyone feels like lending me a vision mixer (or well-specc&#8217;d computer!) for a weekend in December&#8230; \*looks strangely optimistic\* Yeah, okay. Well, if anyone can get me a good deal on a vision mixer (MX-50 is my friend) for a weekend in December&#8230;

(Yeah, I&#8217;ve checked Digihire. They&#8217;re nice people, but cheaper would be better. Church/non-profit event.)
