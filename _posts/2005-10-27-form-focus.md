[Cameron Adams][1] just wrote a piece on form focus with Javascript, because <q cite="http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2005/10/27/">&#8220;your index finger has a finite number of clicks in it&#8221;</q>. His solution works, but [comment #1][2] was a more concise and pragmatic solution.

Good stuff, though I&#8217;m uncertain as to whether I should use it here on the search field or on comment forms.
