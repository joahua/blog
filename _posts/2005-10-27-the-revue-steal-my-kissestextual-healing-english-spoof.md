I&#8217;ve cut a one-act (Bec and Nick&#8217;s take on the English Advanced course) bit of The Revue and compressed it into a digestible chunk, and have published it on [OurMedia][1].

Get the [dialup-happy version here][2] (it&#8217;s 5MB or something), or <del datetime="2005-10-31T08:34:58+00:00">[25MB decent quality version coming, if it ever uploads. Their site sucks. Watch this space.]</del> <ins datetime="2005-10-31T08:34:58+00:00"><a href="http://www.joahua.com/blog/2005/10/31/broadband-ish-steal-my-kissestextual-healing-spoof-online">See this update for more.</a></ins>

OurMedia is terrible to use aside from the whole free bandwidth and storage thing. I honestly don&#8217;t mind supplying ridiculous amounts of metadata, but its interface is absolutely painful &#8212; and, to make things worse, if I do as they recommend and use their crappy &#8220;OurMedia Publisher Tool&#8221; (it sucks, don&#8217;t use it unless someone has a gun to your head, and think twice even then&#8230; the gun to your head may have nothing to do with OurMedia!), I can enter all the metadata I want in its &#8220;helpful&#8221; wizards, and none of it will make it through to the actual site. Thanks guys. I&#8217;m now uploading a higher resolution version *again* via HTTP, because&#8230; yeah, you guessed it, the Publisher tool crashed.

There must be something about that name and crappy software. Microsoft&#8217;s product was (I haven&#8217;t used it for years) far more stable, but equally pathetic.

I&#8217;m thinking about switching across to Google Video instead, but am reluctant to because it locks data in a little bit more&#8230; so, we&#8217;ll see.

<ins datetime="2005-10-31T07:35:35+00:00">Okay, I got sick of trying to publish it for free&#8230; so it&#8217;s going up on the same server hosting the year12.joahua.com site (appropriate, niet?). Audio is a little cleaner in the WMV version&#8230; but if you want near-source quality instead, get the DVD. <a href="http://year12.joahua.com/localvid/englishtextualhealingmashup.wmv">Here&#8217;s the broadband version</a>. If someone feels like contributing captions, be my guest.</ins>
