I managed to get my finger stuck in a car boot last night (n.b. the rest of me was outside the car), so posting will be a little light for the next few days due to mobility restrictions and the difficulty of typing. This should be the case anyway, as I have an Extension English exam Monday and a Modern History exam Thursday, but the increased strain is, inevitably, the deciding factor.

It was my right hand, so I&#8217;m planning on using a scribe for at least the Extension exam (which could be kinda fun, because I can talk about that stuff quite easily, at length. Just like delivering a seminar, only slower and with more pauses to tell some kid in year 11 how to spell various big words that are fun to throw in essays.)

Somehow my left hand has managed to pretty much escape damage all my life, whereas my right has scars on my thumb, middle finger (courtesy of an ice skate), and now a mashed-up nail on what I am reliably informed is known as the &#8220;ring finger&#8221; &#8212; apparently a technical term, because it appeared on my medical certificate!

So there&#8217;s my excuse for not writing lots. Meanwhile, have a picture of a helicopter.

p.s. whilst I *can* type&#8211;this post is testament to that&#8211;, it takes an inordinate amount of effort not to appear as though drunk at the keyboard, if you will. So, it&#8217;s altogether safer just to stay away.
