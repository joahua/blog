<p>Just for fun. And because Google probably won&#8217;t get this indexed until after the Extension English exam tomorrow commences, which means the only people likely to see this in time are those who go to my school anyway ;-)</p>
<p>At any rate, good luck to anyone who feels like trying to memorise any substantialish chunk of this by tomorrow&#8230;</p>
<p>Without further ado, <a href="/blog/wp-content/2005/10/doriangrayquotes.pdf">quotes in PDF format</a>. (53.1KB)</p>

<p>If you want fulltext, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> has <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext94/dgray10h.htm">a nice HTML version</a> (better than plain text because it&#8217;s not scattered with stupid linebreaks).</p>
