So, as soon as I uploaded a moderate-resolution WMV version of [the video][1] to year12.joahua.com, Google Video decided it was going to approve it. However, it seems the Google version is pretty poor quality (yes, I uploaded the same version to both Google and my own site), so if you want quality it&#8217;s best to go with the year12.joahua source &#8212; though the audio quality on both of them seems to be about the same.

The [Google Video version][2] will play in your browser (using Flash Video).  
The [hosted Windows Media version][3] can be saved to your computer (right-click, &#8220;Save Target As&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Save Link As&#8230;&#8221;, depending on the browser).

The Windows Media version is ~23MiB, so I&#8217;d assume the Google version will be (probably significantly) less than that.

<ins>Now with added lyrics!</ins>

(Thanks to Ben, though I don&#8217;t know I agree with the end bit, and think he&#8217;s hashed out sections where it&#8217;s entirely possible nothing was even said :P)
