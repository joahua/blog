This is a seriously cool program. Sure, it&#8217;s just a frontend to mplayer/mencoder, but it&#8217;s so *easy*! Having said that, I&#8217;m still not game to touch more than half the options, but whatever :P I now no longer need to pull out my Coldplay Live 2003 DVD to watch tracks on it :D

(I&#8217;d ripped it before, but couldn&#8217;t figure out how to do individual Chapters as separate files, so the resulting file was the whole DVD)

And yes, this program is probably illegal in Australia, as in the US. But then so are iPods prior to iTMS.
