<p>Just me playing with <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, nothing in particular got burnt in the making of this image.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/2005/11/flameswhite.png"><img src="/blog/wp-content/2005/11/flamessml.png" alt="Flames illustration" /></a></p>
<p>The image links to a larger PNG of the same.</p>
<p>You can also get its <a href="/blog/wp-content/2005/11/flames.svg">Inkscape SVG source file</a>&#8230; it probably won&#8217;t open in certain other editors &#8212; specifically Illustrator (I say this because it&#8217;s been tried before, though not with this particular file). </p>
<p>The advantage of this being an SVG is you can blow it up to whatever resolution you want, get a large format digital printer, and stick it on the side of your fully-sick car, if you so desired. Or, you could just view it on your computer screen!</p>
