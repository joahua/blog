From [an SMH blog comment][1]. I can&#8217;t wait for the next election!

The venerable mum/dad lab/lib metaphor (elucidated [in this piece][2] &#8212; search for &#8220;Labor is mum, the Coalition is dad&#8221; &#8212; and shamelessly repeated by the SMH many times since) is wearing thinner and thinner in NSW, as Labor repeatedly shows itself to be comprehensively incompetent in both the realm of social welfare *and* &#8220;hard&#8221; issues such as keeping contactors in line and maintaining order, etc. And yes, before anyone jumps up and down about it, it *is* playing on gender stereotypes, but it&#8217;s just a convenient metaphor. So get over it.
