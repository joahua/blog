Posting this probably means the RSS users are going to come crawling out in force to *watch* as I break stuff, but whatever. I don&#8217;t really mind, enjoy, if you get kicks out of that kind of thing. I&#8217;m playing with styles/my template for a little bit, because I&#8217;m bored of it and ridiculously sick of how slow Firefox renders position:fixed and my Google ads (and you can say it&#8217;s because Google ads markup sucks all you want, but the fact is Firefox is the only browser that has any significant problem(/s) with it). Mostly because I&#8217;m bored of it and am putting off work on&#8230; a handful of other sites. Oh, and study, but that doesn&#8217;t matter/count coz my next exam is still over a week away.

Think of it as CSS Reboot a day or two late. Or whatever. I&#8217;ve actually had the base of the stylesheet ready for a while, but it was initially designed as a print version. Then I decided it was simple (which is what I&#8217;m aiming for a lot lately) and looked niceish. I think I was subconsciously (or maybe not? I dunno) taking off [Anne&#8217;s][1] now-not-so-recent site redesign, which basically involved reverting to a single column with clear readable text and disabling comments more often. I&#8217;m not so keen on the latter as last time I tried to do that people got annoyed, and it was mostly just because (I think) I was posting dumb angsty stuff I didn&#8217;t really want people replying to. Maybe. Or not. That might&#8217;ve been the time before&#8230; I can&#8217;t remember, too long ago. I&#8217;m also not so keen on big rants about hardcore markup stuff. I could deal with living in Scandenavia, though, because those countries are cool. I don&#8217;t really know why. I told Tori this today and she gave me weird looks like I&#8217;m stalking Henrik Ibsen. I&#8217;m not. I just think he&#8217;s a cool playwright, and am appreciative of his characters and ideologies. Heh, on more trivial matters, I like the idea of extended character sets because it gives me an excuse to use UTF-8 more often.

Anyway. Whatever. Before I start making changes, mostly for historical purposes, this design involves large expanses of white, a fixed-width layout (so I can think about worrying about photos less), and none of the larger graphical elements from [SC500][2] are being retained. I&#8217;ll probably find it boring around February, (I&#8217;d say sooner, but I&#8217;m going to be <acronym title="Away from keyboard">AFK</acronym> for nearly a month, so that extends its novelty value somewhat further) at which point I&#8217;ll probably go with something complex(-er).

Having said that, my present design (the one I&#8217;m about to start implementing) could gradually evolve to a more complex beast, in which case I&#8217;ll get sick of its evolved complexity and go back to something simple again. Ah, design. It&#8217;s cyclic.

I also have some interesting ideas for livesearch/navigation, loosely based on Shaun Inman&#8217;s present site and [Matthom&#8217;s recent comments on search][3]. Which I want to implement quickly to beat him to it ;-) Basically it&#8217;s figuring out a layout that intuitively combines search, whilst remaining &#8220;blog-like&#8221; (because I value that, see my comment on Matthom&#8217;s original post) and visually simple.
