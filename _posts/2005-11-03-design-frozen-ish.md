Okay, I haven&#8217;t checked it in anything but Firefox, though the CSS should be simple enough not to screw up in any major browsers. What you&#8217;re seeing (assuming you&#8217;re not reading this from the year 2045 or whatever) is the base design from which I&#8217;d like to do some innovative crap. Like a floating livesearch menu that expands from an unobtrusive (yet omnipresent) design element and sits translucent on the side of the screen. Amongst other things. It&#8217;s not amazingly groundbreaking, I guess, but I&#8217;d like to do it nicely/well.

Maybe the breaking down of chronology could happen at some point, but I don&#8217;t really have any great ideas as to how to do that effectively. I also haven&#8217;t bothered to validate this thing yet. Should do that at some point. It&#8217;s semantically fine, though.
