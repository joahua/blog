Okay, if this isn&#8217;t already all over the web it should be, and I&#8217;m posting about it anyway because Sony/the agency that did it deserve all the viral marketing they get over [this ad][1].

![Capture from the commercial][2]

No CG (well, probably in the transition at the end, but that doesn&#8217;t count). Lots of bouncy balls. The making-of featurette (on the [&#8220;Behind the Scenes&#8221; page][3]) is worth a look, too&#8230; the camera operators are wearing head gear, and there are people with those plexiglass riot shield things. All the cars were props, but in the making of you can still hear alarms going off&#8230; I imagine that could be a byproduct of the small earth tremor released by 250,000 balls pelting down a hill.

I&#8217;m not in the market for an LCD TV, but&#8230; damn. I don&#8217;t know quite how these things can be technically significantly better than anything else on the market, but I&#8217;m now interested to find out. And have a pro-Sony bias, at least for this product (definitely not for their audio equipment or their record label or digital cameras or&#8230; the list goes on).

The video is in H.264 format but even the broadband version isn&#8217;t massive. I dig the music, though.
