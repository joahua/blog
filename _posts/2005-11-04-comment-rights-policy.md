Okay. I&#8217;m writing a real post about the comment policy (in response to [this comment][1] from [Dale][2]) just so it&#8217;s a little more visible/obvious/open. I thought about his remark and wondered if he read the Copyright page, or just the line &#8220;Submitted comments become [copyright-ish][3] to Joshua Street/this site.&#8221; (That wasn&#8217;t an attack&#8230; just a question, and a potential source of confusion. For the record, Michael, this isn&#8217;t directed at you&#8230; you just brought up the question first :-))

If there&#8217;s concern about me &#8220;owning&#8221; them, the wording suggests you mightn&#8217;t have read the Copyright page itself. It&#8217;s pretty open-ended, partially because I reject the idea of idea-ownership to some extent (certainly text ownership), and also as recognition of the practicality of copyright protection on the Internet. That is, it&#8217;s impossible to keep something in the one place even if you want to, so embrace it.

I&#8217;ve ditched my old CC license because:

1.  *It* was too over the top and complicated for a personal site. I don&#8217;t need that jargon. If you don&#8217;t respect plain English imperatives to copy or not copy in a certain way, you&#8217;re scum, and there&#8217;s little long-winded legal crap will do to change that.
2.  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any reason, aside from vanity, for me to *require* attribution. It&#8217;s *nice*, but hardly something that I should bind ideas or even just text to.
3.  Nothing I write here is of significant commercial value. The exception to that is potential reproduction of *some* pieces that may be of use in commercial publications (web or print) as standalone articles. And, in that case, attribution would be *really* nice&#8230; I just can&#8217;t be bothered trying to enforce that, or even having to think about it. In saying this I accept *some* market value for my work, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s significant enough for me to care. And micro-payments are as much effort as normal payments to set up, and, to be perfectly honest, I doubt anyone&#8217;s that interested in my content.

This change simplifies my sitewide copyright policy&#8230; and it only made sense to include comments in that. Because this is a blog, and not a &#8216;zine or whatever the heck we called these things back when they were static and non-interactive, comments are an intrinsic part of it most of the time. They value-add (hah, yes, again assigning value!) the original article by augmenting its content, illuminating its foibles, and elucidating alternate points of view where opinion/conjecture comes into play. Thus, to separate them can, potentially, be damaging to the content.

I don&#8217;t want to break that.

So far as I could see, applying a uniform policy was the only way to ensure it didn&#8217;t *have* to be broken. And I know I haven&#8217;t said this in the past, but I figure if people are prepared to contribute their ideas to a public forum hosted by someone else with relation to an *agenda* set by someone else, they&#8217;re probably not too worried about who reads them/where they go.

This isn&#8217;t a legal thing, mostly. It&#8217;s more about etiquette. I&#8217;m saying it&#8217;s okay to take what you want from here, and use it for what you will. I&#8217;m &#8212; tentatively &#8212; including comments in that. Now would be a great time to read over [my &#8220;Copyright. Ish.&#8221; page][4] and decide what you think for yourself &#8212; and if you&#8217;ve commented here in the past and want to tie your content down, let me know. (Somehow&#8230; I&#8217;ll get the contact form going again soon, until then there&#8217;s always the mobile number listed on that page, or that page&#8217;s own comment form) I&#8217;ll respect that, either by deleting the comment &#8212; if it contributes insignificantly to the discussion &#8212; or appending a notice to it stating it&#8217;s not for the taking. I really think *that* is over the top, though.

If you have any comments on this, I&#8217;d invite you to use [the comment facility on the Copyright page][5]. (Comments are disabled on this post to encourage you to use that instead. This is because it&#8217;s static, and more permanent.)

<small>p.s. Note that <em>some</em> content on this site is non-free, or only available in a limited form online. The <a href="/cat-scan/">photos</a>, for example, are available in whatever resolution is there&#8230; but I have better quality source archived, which I&#8217;ll generally only publish on a whim or for profit ;-)</small>
