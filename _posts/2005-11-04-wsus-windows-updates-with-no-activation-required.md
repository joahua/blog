A little birdy told me that using [WSUS][1] means you don&#8217;t need to have activated (i.e. legit) versions of Windows or other Microsoft products. I&#8217;ve had instances where, on reinstalling Windows XP (slipstreamed SP2), over-the-net activation wouldn&#8217;t work at all and I didn&#8217;t get a chance to phone activate for about three weeks. Wasn&#8217;t a huge problem because of course IE wasn&#8217;t the default browser and I refuse to let people install MSN Messenger (if they&#8217;re using Windows, they have to use the no-frills, relatively secure and quick Windows Messenger!), and there was anti-virus stuff installed, but that&#8217;s a while to be running unpatched Windows.

In a small bus environment, WSUS means you can avoid potential headaches like that. In a paranoid reluctant-MS-user environment, it means you can (illegally) crack your (legally purchased) operating system, and enjoy updates without having to hand out your details on a platter. Or, alternatively, if you&#8217;re a comprehensive Microsoft pirate from the server to the desktop, you can take further advantage of their hospitality by enjoying the fine update services they have to offer. ;-)

Hey, if you&#8217;re going to steal software at least do it well!

More generally speaking, WSUS just looks like a cool tool. You download once, apply many, and manage what patches do/don&#8217;t get installed from a central location.

**Disclaimer**: I haven&#8217;t tried WSUS, this is just second-hand. We only use appropriately licensed Microsoft products here. I&#8217;m publishing this because being subversive is fun, if a little childish, and this could conceivably (legitimately or otherwise) be of use to someone.
