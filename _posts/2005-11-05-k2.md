Far out. K2 is awesome. I&#8217;m currently ripping code from it for live search stuff, because it&#8217;s written sensibly. Unlike various plugins and other &#8220;howto&#8221; guides out there.

I&#8217;m reluctant to use it, as I am reluctant to base any WP theme I make on Kubrick, not because of any perception of it as being *banal* and overused (though I suppose there is some of that), but mostly because it&#8217;s a *very* comprehensive place to start from, and I find myself with larger quantities of redundant code.

This theme has a freaking Options page in the admin panel! I didn&#8217;t even know you could *do* that!

Anyway. Back to trying to make things work&#8230;
