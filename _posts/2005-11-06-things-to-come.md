About to launch a new site. Exciting. This is the first site I&#8217;ve fully designed in a *graphics* app (namely [Inkscape][1] &#8212; yes, a vector graphics app! Worked *really* well!) before introducing CSS: I dropped the idea of &#8220;CSS-based design&#8221; for a while and think it turned out quite nicely. The project was gratis for an open-source project mentioned before on this site, encompassing logo and site design. This is the &#8220;more visually complex&#8221; design [I alluded to][2] two days ago. It mightn&#8217;t seem particularly dark if you have a large screen, but the content area is certainly less bright. It doesn&#8217;t have a &#8216;dark&#8217; feel, though &#8212; quite the opposite.

The design is about primary colours, which represent the purpose of the project itself. From that you might have guessed what I&#8217;m talking about, but I&#8217;ll continue to be dramatic until I&#8217;m ready to say &#8220;hey, it&#8217;s launched, go look.&#8221; Well, actually, it won&#8217;t be &#8220;launched&#8221; until early December in a marketing sense, but the site will be &#8216;live&#8217; sometime in the next 48 hours, albeit with some content missing.

<img src="/blog/wp-content/2005/11/teaser.png" alt="A blurred screenshot" style="float:left;" />I hope my usual standards of markup propriety have been upheld &#8212; I even bothered to validate this one before launch, catching two potentially embarrassing unencoded ampersands (because I completely forgot we&#8217;re meant to do that. I haven&#8217;t used them for so long, but the typeface has nice ampersands so I wanted to!) &#8212; but most of all, at least for me, this design is about *design*. I say without hesitation it&#8217;s the best I&#8217;ve ever come up with.

I&#8217;m hoping to enjoy working with Inkscape as a design tool more in the future, because it really is excellent! Expect an announcement about the site&#8217;s launch in the next 24 hours &#8212; until then, feel free to try and guess what it is! ;-)
