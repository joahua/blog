If you&#8217;re reading this (e.g. the world didn&#8217;t end before it was posted or whatever&#8230;), I&#8217;m probably on the Other Side of the HSC. For various reasons, this might be the last post before I go to New Zealand, in which case don&#8217;t expect another post for three weeks. I&#8217;m going to delete everything in my moderation queue when I get back, because I don&#8217;t have enough time to go through all the spam that will probably accumulate (or, am not planning on having enough time&#8230; I might, if the spammers are nice for three weeks.) &#8212; this won&#8217;t impact most regulars, though, whose posts should get through just fine. Ah, I love software that just works. I can see it&#8217;s not likely to, though!

Tori is leaving for Europe tomorrow (tomorrow when this post goes live), and she&#8217;s not getting back til January :-( Hence the improbabilty of my posting at least in the next 48 hours, and possibly before I leave if it takes me longer than expected to pack/get organised.

I also may or may not have a heap of photos to post when I get back. We leave in&#8230; a handful of days now, and I still haven&#8217;t decided which/how many cameras I&#8217;m taking, nor have I bought film. Bleh!
