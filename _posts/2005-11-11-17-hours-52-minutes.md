That&#8217;s the length of audio I can record on my camera with just the new 1GB memory card I got today for it. With the 256MB card recording 4 hours and 18 minutes, I can record the 23 hours and 10 minutes from now until when our flight leaves tomorrow (~1845 GMT+10)! But I&#8217;m not going to.

Technology rocks!
