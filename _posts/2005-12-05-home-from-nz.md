So I guess this means I should [hurry up and post something][1]. Too late/tired tho. I&#8217;m currently rotating photographs (the digital ones, haven&#8217;t put any of the four rolls of 35mm in for processing yet), and might possibly post a selection tomorrow. Maybe.

I&#8217;m now convinced my digital camera isn&#8217;t quite as magical in terms of quality as I&#8217;d once supposed. I was a bit trigger-happy and not particularly prudent in planning a lot of shots with the digital camera, and it shows. Mostly with colour balance/peaking. I can attribute that in part to being outdoors and having a tiny LCD viewfinder, but I can also attribute some photos to not bothering to stop walking whilst taking a shot, not waiting for exposure/focus to set on half-depress before taking a photo, etc. I was just lazy.

Anyway, I took enough photos there is good stuff there regardless. It&#8217;s actually mostly pretty good, but I was a bit disappointed with the peaking colours. Meh! The 1GB read fine on my Ubuntu box, for the record, so Windows just sucks. &#8216;Nuff said.
