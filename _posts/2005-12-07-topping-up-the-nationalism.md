Well I now feel thoroughly Australian again. A 40 degree day (104 degrees if you&#8217;re American/use Fahrenheit) and a trip to the beach saw the national spirit cemented. Or perhaps fermented. Or melted. Whatever.

Having said that, I *did* go to Coogee beach. So I guess that means I could well be a kiwi, or a pom, or&#8230; from a fair few other places in Europe. Meh!

p.s. 40 degrees was recorded at Sydney Airport, which is the closest observation station here. So it actually did reach that temperature even in the East! Olympic Park topped it at 40.1 degrees, but that&#8217;s not particularly surprising given the location&#8230; in fact, it&#8217;s surprising they&#8217;re that close! I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s way too hot in Australia (or at least Sydney in Summer) and have decided it&#8217;d be great to move South&#8230; or to Europe or somewhere lots colder. Scandinavia, perhaps!
