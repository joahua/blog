I thought I&#8217;d seen it done in the past, but I was playing around with it today and couldn&#8217;t get it to work. So maybe it&#8217;s not.

Basically the only way I could get PAL Composite or S-Video output to work was if I set it up as the primary (sole) display. Which really sucks. I mean, it&#8217;s not a terribly major thing, but it&#8217;s also very irritating. Bleeeeehhh.

Anyone had any luck in the past with that on a TNT2?
