Photoshop, graphics heavy-weight app that it is, does not feel like it should ever be used for web design prototyping. I&#8217;m new to this whole gig, having used the GIMP for several years now (on and off since 2001) but even that is still a graphics application and not&#8230; a web one.

On a small-ish site, even a minor change becomes hellish &#8212; someone asked me to change the font size down a bit, which of course involved going to TOO MANY BLOODY LAYERS and manually adjusting the font size. And don&#8217;t even ask about form controls&#8230; Mocking that up involves layers, placement&#8230; but none of it synced to the font size. So when I change the font size, the forms of course are all out of position.

CSS&#8230; I change two digits and the entire site changes along with them. Magic.

p.s. Oh, yeah, and how the hell do you markup a TABLE in Photoshop? Dumb dumb dumb!
