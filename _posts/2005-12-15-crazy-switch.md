My switch has been playing up the past few days&#8230; eugh. It&#8217;ll work perfectly for two minutes, then cut out for thirty seconds to two minutes, and repeat. This basically means I can&#8217;t download anything in Firefox (wget handles a little better&#8230; not much, but a little), and Ximian Evolution keeps crashing as it loses the IMAP (or Exchange) link and wonders what the hell happened. Oh, yeah, and the fact that Ubuntu&#8217;s clock/calendar is intrinsically linked with the mail client means I&#8217;ve been using `date` and `cal -m`&#8230; far out, I may as well just start using mutt or something!

More seriously, I&#8217;m thinking I might actually have to plug stuff directly into the router here (shock), or start using the ancient Baystack thing&#8230; but I can&#8217;t use that til after Sunday (Christmas Carols service alluded to previously&#8230; can&#8217;t be bothered finding a link) seeing as I&#8217;m going to use it as my &#8216;portable&#8217; hub just in case I need to transfer stuff between computers and&#8230; run out of blank discs or both my SD cards and readers die or something. More probably, that a file is too enormous for a CD (only one machine has a DVD burner, and I&#8217;m not editing on it). Whatever. Dying switches suck.
