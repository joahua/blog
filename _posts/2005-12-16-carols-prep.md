![A photo of my messy living room][1]

I just turned off everything having finished playing/editing for the night, and took a step back to realise how much of a mess I&#8217;d created. There&#8217;s some excess gear (i.e. not for carols) in that shot above, but I&#8217;m still going to end up transporting more stuff than you can see there. Sigh. Good fun, though.

I might throw a web version up later (not quite at the stage where I can stream stuff live just yet &#8212; give it a few months ;-)), because there are only two carols on the programme under [APRA][2]/[CCLI][3] (the rest are public-domain)&#8230; so I might just cut out those two songs and publish the rest. If I can be bothered, and have time to setup capture, and capture works okay. Haven&#8217;t exactly got a DVC-PRO deck lying around, so I&#8217;ll be capturing straight to a PC&#8230; the problem is the PC with capture gear I want to use for replay.

Incidentally, whilst walking the dog today, I stumbled upon about 10 computers that had been dumped on the side of the road (not as sus as it sounds&#8230; the footpath was raised from the road, so it looked like someone had just had some fun chucking them off the edge. Mostly old Pentiums and so on.) and wound up carrying two of them home (whilst trying to hold a dog) &#8212; my arms hurt. Why did I carry two of them home? I was curious as to what was in them and wasn&#8217;t carrying a screwdriver on my keyring, because one looked like an ATX case (it wasn&#8217;t, just a slightly slimmer-than-usual-AT-case) and the other had Composite, S-Video, and an ambiguously-named &#8220;CCD-IN&#8221; port (it&#8217;s a 9-pin DIN socket I think&#8230; can&#8217;t be bothered getting up to check!) on a card on the back.

The motherboards are pretty good for their vintage (ATX-supporting Socket 7, one with onboard hardware audio and graphics&#8230; no, it&#8217;s not a Dell or Gateway or any of that proprietry crap.), but it still wasn&#8217;t worth carrying them. And there&#8217;s no way I can be bothered carrying them back now!

Anyway this card with S-Video and Composite sockets on it is actually an old-ish capture card, which *might* work with V4L and almost certainly *doesn&#8217;t* work with post-Windows &#8217;98/NT4.0 Microsoft systems. Chances are it&#8217;d be crap quality capture anyway, and I&#8217;m unlikely to have time to setup/even try to setup it in any semi-working fashion before Sunday afternoon!

(Aside: I really need to buy an el-cheapo $60 TV-tuner for another computer at some point.)

Okay, I&#8217;m off to bed. Got to wake up tomorrow, render video, check UAI, panic/celebrate/think &#8220;I was anxious about *that*?&#8221;/get over it, do inventory here, then pack a van full of gear (oh and need to find boxes for my LCDs&#8230; should do that now actually, bit worried about them) and go and panic some more about how I have not enough cameras and not enough cables. Of course, if I have no cameras then the absence of cables ceases to be such a sensitive issue. Just gotta pray lots about it&#8230; there&#8217;s not really much more I can do at this point.

Oh, and if my posting about this strikes anyone as being in a more concerned tone than with previous events, it&#8217;s because this little excursion into vision is something new for me. I&#8217;ve encountered all this stuff before, but never in the capacity that if something screwed up during the event it&#8217;d be considered my fault ;-) Well, you know, shots of the wrong &#8216;guest speaker&#8217; at SACS speech night betrayed by an uncertain zoom out aside. Doo bee doo.
