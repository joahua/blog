Woo. Popped into Jaycar yesterday evening to buy some tape for Sunday, and they had [quad-screened Belden 75 Ohm coax][1] in their offcuts/discount box! It&#8217;s priced as if it were 5M, but I think it&#8217;s probably closer to 7 or 8, and the quality is brilliant. Even with crappy non-crimp (screw on) connectors. I got home and kicked myself because there is a tool here that can probably crimp on the ends, but I didn&#8217;t remember at the time and just wanted something that worked! Heh.

We&#8217;re still probably a bit short on cables, but I&#8217;m hoping to use this from the MX-50 to the projector (control is gonna be just behind the screen, and it&#8217;s not a particularly long throw)&#8230; so I just need to get ONE MORE cable sorted for camera #2 and everything is good. Assuming we have enough cameras, but that&#8217;s a whole different kettle of fish, with several people fishing, so God-willing we&#8217;ll get something sorted in time there. If not, it&#8217;s going to be great quality playback with crap quality live vision! Ah well, we can but try!

Anyway, I&#8217;m about to disappear and pick up my new toy for the weekend&#8230; Hello Panasonic MX-50!
