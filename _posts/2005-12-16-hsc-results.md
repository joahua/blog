Today annoys me because the numbers released don&#8217;t mean anything. It&#8217;s just appetite-whetting statistics, making one more impatient for 9am tomorrow when the *real* results are released! Oh, yes, for anyone who cares to know, my marks were about what I&#8217;d expected. Advanced English was higher (I got band 6!! My presumptuousness in those two exams must have gone down well&#8230; as confidence or something. Whatever, it worked!), and ITF was lower (probably should have studied a *bit* for that!), and Modern and Business were&#8230; significantly higher than state average, but still pretty &#8216;middle-of-the-road&#8217; IMO. Whatever. Oh and I got E4 for both Extension courses&#8230; would have liked a higher Ext2 mark, but whatever. Probably the (unpublished, unlikely to be published) reflection statement dragged it down, seeing as it was written&#8230; last-minute-ish. Or maybe that didn&#8217;t drag it down and they just didn&#8217;t like the story. Who knows. Whatever :P It&#8217;s over!

Aside: is this the second-last entry under &#8220;School&#8221; on this blog?
