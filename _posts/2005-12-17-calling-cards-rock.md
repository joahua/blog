Far out. I didn&#8217;t realise how cheap these things were: Voice over IP has nothing on calling cards.

I just called Tori in HK for about 30 minutes and it&#8217;s like&#8230; ~1.5c/minute. That&#8217;s 45c, which is nearly as cheap as a local call from a payphone here in Australia. Sure, there&#8217;s the cost of a local call to connect to the calling card service &#8212; let&#8217;s say ~20c, but still&#8230; wow. The cheapest VoIP rates here for the same service are still like 5c/minute or thereabouts.

Good stuff!

Also good stuff is the reason I was calling (well, at least part of)&#8230; Tori was in the SMH for getting Band 6 in every unit (along with Louis Garrick and Angus Thompson from SACS)!
