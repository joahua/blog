![My dog staring at a keyboard][1]

Not strictly *my* dog, but still&#8230; heh. He&#8217;s a geek. Heh.

<ins datetime="2005-12-17T09:50:07+00:00">Addendum: I know it&#8217;s a crap photo. I accidentally took it with the flash on (for some arbitary reason I&#8217;d been using it the night before and had forgotten to turn it back off like I normally have it), and the dog moved before I could take a good second photo. No, it wasn&#8217;t posed.</ins>
