I&#8217;ve fallen in love with PDF all over again. Well&#8230; not quite. But it&#8217;s pretty cool.

I think it was [Steve][1] I was speaking to a few days back, and he alluded to Acrobat&#8217;s slide transition capabilities, of which I knew nothing. Until I installed [OpenOffice.org 2.0][2] on a machine I&#8217;m using for playback tomorrow and discovered that I couldn&#8217;t get it to fullscreen on a secondary monitor (and for various reasons I&#8217;m not willing to make my playback screen the primary monitor :|). So I figured that maybe Acrobat would.

Pull up the PDF export dialogue&#8230; oh, an option to save transitions, cool (I didn&#8217;t use it, but it&#8217;s nice to know it&#8217;s there). More importantly, there&#8217;s now a lossless compression option in OpenOffice&#8217;s export! Off to Acrobat Reader to open it up, and&#8230; yes. All still there, great quality, and it will fullscreen on whatever display you have the window on. Beautiful.
