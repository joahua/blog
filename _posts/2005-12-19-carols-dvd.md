I just finished watching the DVD we recorded and have to say I&#8217;m actually pretty happy with it. Which *is* saying something, because I&#8217;d never used a vision mixer for a whole production before, even if I had a pretty good idea how they worked from incidental usage/exposure. Thanks God! Sound is a bit patchy, but Audio were recording and I&#8217;m gonna see if I can patch things up a bit (a lot) from that version, and then I&#8217;ll probably make use of Google Video once more (because Ourmedia sucks) to share it with the world.

Expect that up (there&#8217;ll be two versions for the bandwidth-challenged/indifferent, don&#8217;t worry) in the next day or two, along with a handful of photos of gear and other geeky miscellany.
