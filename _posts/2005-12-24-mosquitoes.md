The most frustrating thing in the world is knowing that you have several bites from a single mosquito, thinking that it&#8217;s probably going to die because it&#8217;s had too much to drink &#8212; revenge!! &#8211;, and then realising its pain will be over as its stomach explodes, probably without it even realising &#8212; do mosquitoes have brains? &#8212; whilst you will have to live with the itches for the next several days. Ah, summer.
