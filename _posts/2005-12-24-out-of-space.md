Yesterday I realised my 40GB hard drive was finally full. And it was a most unpleasant sensation. Now I need to actually get a fileserver working, because it&#8217;s way too much hassle to install a new hard drive in this machine + copy stuff onto it (I&#8217;m out of IDE channels so I can&#8217;t just bang a new one in). Because, you know, setting up a fileserver is just so much more trivial.

One of the reasons the hard drive is so full is the ridiculous number of photos I take. The situation isn&#8217;t assisted by ridiculously beautiful sunsets ridiculously often. These two just in:

![A sunset][1]  
![Another sunset][2]

I&#8217;m contemplating moving all my photos onto the PC known as Media on our network (it&#8217;s a Shuttle XPC thing with Windows MCE installed), because it has a 320GB hard drive, and because WOW Media Center&#8217;s photo album playback is awesome. I used it today and was *very* impressed. Definitely not for everything, but if you just have a heap of photos to go through sequentially it&#8217;s great. I was sitting there with a remote clicking &#8220;next next next&#8221; as required, and it was a throughly painless experience.

[Aside: I am proud at having combined these three things -- starting with my running out of disc space, actually more due to video than photos, but I needed the photo reference to launch into the sunset big and onwards to Media Center -- under the title of "Out of space". It really only applies *well* to the first one, but hopefully the post meandered transparently enough that no-one noticed or cared. I say this now because [evidently][3] people do read what I write here *for* the writing. Curious as to whether or not I can get criticism as well as praise, or if people will choose to say nothing at all rather than something nice. Not that I mind comments that are nice, but... it'd be good to move beyond that. Okay, this aside is *definitely* outside the scope of the title!]

Having said all that, Merry Christmas all. That bears *absolutely* no relation to the title, unless you&#8217;re some weird conspiracy theorist who is convinced that Jesus was sent by Martians. I prefer to believe he&#8217;s the son of God, which might strike some as no less weird, but at least it&#8217;s historically correlated (both in prior prophecy and contemporary recording)! Whatever your perspective, try and think about why you&#8217;re celebrating Christmas this year&#8230;
