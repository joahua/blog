No time to do this justice, need sleep, but had to [post this link][1] from earlier today. It&#8217;s about a Russian photographer in the early 20th century who developed a unique colour photography system. Good stuff. Make sure you follow the link through to the [Library of Congress exhibition pages][2] with more photos, etc!
