Took a bunch of photos of the [Sydney to Hobart start][1] yesterday, about as many of helicopters (there were 18 up there, only major networks I didn&#8217;t see were Ten and SBS) as of boats. Meh!

Here are a few pics from the lot.

![Competitors have mostly left by now, but the exclusion zone is still clearly visible as there is a defined line boats hover on the edge of, appearing to extend the shore outwards.][5]
