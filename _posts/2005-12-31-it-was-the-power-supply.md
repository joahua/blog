Yeah. Oh yeah. Everything else works fine, but the brand-name power supply (AOpen) had to keel over and die. Admittedly, it was only a 235W in a system with two optical drives, two hard drives, and a 1.8GHz processor with 768MB of RAM (I just kept adding things to it without really thinking about power til yesterday, when the type of crash/hang I kept getting struck me as being a classic power problem), but&#8230; a *web-cam*?!

That&#8217;s ridiculous. But true.

Anyway, I&#8217;m planning on violating (yet again &#8212; serial offender, here) the &#8220;No user-serviceable parts&#8221; sticker on the now-dead power supply so I can fix it to use it in another system. I swapped it out for some generic Happy Star Lucky Fortune Power thing (yeah, the name is parodic&#8230; it mightn&#8217;t have to be, though!) I had lying around &#8212; only 250 watts, mind &#8212; and everything turned back on again.

Well, kinda. The web-cam still doesn&#8217;t work on this machine, but I&#8217;m inclined to think that&#8217;s Linux (kernel-level/modprobe crap) being screwy, and not hardware particularly. Might be power again, but I doubt it.

And the web-cam is fine. I tested it on a Windows box and was delighted with the rather-un-crappy quality of it. Which you&#8217;d kinda expect seeing as it does 1.3MP still images, but I digress. Fixed-focus, but the exposure auto-balance is pretty decent, so I&#8217;m happy. Good exposure capabilities are what make crappy cameras less crappy.

As for the hub-that-wasn&#8217;t-a-switch, well&#8230; it&#8217;s going back this afternoon, if the place is open. They open IT-shop-like hours (i.e. open late, close later :P), so I&#8217;ll head down after midday. Hopefully I can just get a refund on the 3Com hub, because I don&#8217;t really need a new switch after all (though I *want* one that&#8217;s more solid + doesn&#8217;t make squealing noises incessantly!).

Oh, yeah, pictures. Here&#8217;s the 3Com hub on the inside. Because I had to unplug the fans, which were grinding annoyingly (barely spinning), and because I make it a habit to open up any bit of second hand gear to check for&#8230; dust, insects, anthrax. Whatever. The real reason is geekery.

Note howit&#8217;s designed to readily accommodate 24 ports. The 6 port model, reputedly, also has the same design, though presumably you&#8217;d need different types of chips there (divide 12 by three then try and multiply by a whole number to get 6&#8230; you can&#8217;t). Anyway, it&#8217;s after 12&#8230; I&#8217;m off!
