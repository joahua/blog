I &#9829; the GIMP.

The above edit (dark is before, light &#8212; visible &#8212; is after) took me about a minute and a half, and went something like Curve, Despeckle, Resample (scale for web), Despeckle (finer adjustment on wand-selected area), Unsharp Mask. I don&#8217;t think I even know how to *do* all those things on Photoshop!

But that wasn&#8217;t the purpose of this post. The darker original was the source from which I extracted the quite-visible lighter version. That is why I nearly *always* shoot with my flash off: it&#8217;s possible to recover ridiculous amounts from the shadows &#8212; even with a crappy digital that won&#8217;t let you use RAW &#8212; but it&#8217;s nigh on impossible to recover that lost to the nether-regions of over-exposed stock.
