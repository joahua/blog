This is from last week. It&#8217;s been out a while, but I&#8217;ve been insatiably lazy when it comes to posting. So, at 22:20 on a Sunday night, I finally make time for it. Ah well.

[cat-scan 1.0 is out.][1] Which is great news. Won&#8217;t post too much about it here, but definitely worth a look if previous versions have seemed like too much hassle to setup or whatever.

What&#8217;s not quite such great news is that Ben&#8217;s gone to the UK for a year. Well, great news if you&#8217;re in the UK, I guess :P Either way, he&#8217;s got a [shiny new blog up and running][2] to tell us all about it. Or something. I&#8217;m meant to do him a non-default-WP template for it sometime, but&#8230; well, going on my current rate-of-achievement, that&#8217;ll be sometime before he gets back ;-) Nope, not going to be any more specific :P

If anyone else was wondering what the image for the 1.0 launch announcement post was, yes, we do have shirts. Or rather, Ben does, and it&#8217;s a bit small, and it was my going away pressie for him :P So now cat-scan is taking over the world in a more literal fashion (hah, fashion). Well&#8230; it mightn&#8217;t, because Bonds don&#8217;t make Medium the same size as everyone else&#8230; and it&#8217;s probably a little small. Whatever, sorry Ben! Enjoy the singlet!

In other news&#8230; I think Katy left to Honduras for 3 weeks on a short-term mission sometime today, which is pretty exciting. Hopefully will hear all about it from her when she gets back and stuff.

I&#8217;m sure I missed a load of various things, but I need to go sleep so that&#8217;ll have to do for the time being.
