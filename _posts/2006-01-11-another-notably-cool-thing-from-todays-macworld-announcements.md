Magnetic power connectors in the new (but slightly-stupidly named) MacBook Pro rock my socks. Mostly because I&#8217;ve experienced breaking power connectors before as a result of too many insert/remove cycles, and magnetically charged connectors just&#8230; have incredible cool factor. They probably don&#8217;t work a great deal better, but who cares?
