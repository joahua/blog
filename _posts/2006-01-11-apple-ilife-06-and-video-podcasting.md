iMovie&#8217;s [in-built &#8220;video podcasting&#8221; (they like getting their brand in there somewhere) capabilities][1] are far more exciting to me than iWeb alone (the two seem to be integrated). More will hopefully be happening on the mediacasting/video podcasting front in the near future, watch this space!
