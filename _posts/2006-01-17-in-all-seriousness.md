&#8230; how can anyone (myself included in this) have used &#8220;Layout Tables&#8221; for any extended period of time and not enacted mass murders?

No sitewide styles? Constantly resetting fonts to browser defaults? Minimal typographical control without inline styles? The need to use CELLS for whitespace? What the. Excuse me whilst I vomit all over the shoes of whoever once said table-based design was easier than CSS. Have a noose.

p.s. this is more frustrating than ANY graphics app could be for building web pages. At least in those you have the zoom facility to get pixel-perfect precision with no great effort. In Frontpage, you wind up manipulating cells pixel-by-pixel, cell-by-cell, irrespective of whether or not it&#8217;s considered a &#8220;WYSIWYG&#8221; app.
