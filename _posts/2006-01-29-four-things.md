It&#8217;s [Matthom&#8217;s fault.][1]

### Four jobs I have had

1.  IT support/troubleshooting guy
2.  Westfield Christmas decorations assembler at some signage place
3.  Web&#8230; something. Designer/markup guru/accessibility consultant/CSS wizard/JavaScript mangler extraordinaire. That&#8217;s really a job title.
4.  I&#8217;m all out, I think. Can I do &#8220;Three things&#8221; instead?

### Four movies I can watch over and over again

1.  The Matrix (and *ONLY* the Matrix, not :Reloaded or :Revolutions, because they sucked bigtime)
2.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
3.  Underworld :D If anyone (in Sydney) wants to go see the sequel sometime let me know&#8230;
4.  Ice Age

### Four places I have lived

1.  Lat: 33:54:24S (-33.9067) Lon: 151:13:01E (151.2169)
2.  Lat: 33:54:44S (-33.9122) Lon: 151:12:50E (151.2139)
3.  Lat: 33:54:23S (-33.9063) Lon: 151:13:30E (151.2249)
4.  Lat: 33:55:09S (-33.9190) Lon: 151:14:14E (151.2373)

### Four TV shows I love

1.  Um. Wrong person. I&#8217;m going to tag Steve at the end of this post, which should be most amusing. Hopefully he&#8217;ll [name a podcast instead!][2]

### Four places Iâ€™ve vacationed

1.  New Zealand
2.  A boat. A big boat.
3.  Mansfield, VIC
4.  Tea Gardens/Hawks Nest, NSW :)

### Four of my favorite dishes

1.  I hate this question.
2.  I can&#8217;t even choose food in a restaurant, from a menu.
3.  Let alone with out any guidance in some forever-bounced-around-the-blogosphere meme.
4.  This is my answer. My favourite dish is indecision.

### Four sites I visit daily

1.  [Google.][3] Duh.
2.  [Quirksmode][4], but rarely not-through Google.
3.  [My comment-spam moderation page :-/][5]
4.  [whisper.joahua.com][6], for music playback. I&#8217;ll post about this sometime.

### Four places I would rather be right now

This isn&#8217;t really a valid question seeing I&#8217;m doing this on a weekend. Not fair.

1.  Bed.
2.  Floating in a pool somewhere. Not normally me, but for some reason that has enormous appeal right now.
3.  On a couch, reading a book (without thinking &#8220;I&#8217;ve got so much other stuff to do! I haven&#8217;t got time to read!&#8221;)
4.  Making engaging rich media for the web. Scheduled for later today. One of several exciting things coming soon!

### Four bloggers I&#8217;m tagging

1.  [Steve][7]
2.  [Ben][8]
3.  [LTTD][9], mostly because I want to see how a collective weblog would deal with this whole&#8230; blogging equivalent of chain-mail thing.
4.  I can&#8217;t think of anyone else (who hasn&#8217;t already been tagged/done it) I&#8217;d want to inflict this on :P

This is interesting, because I once completely shunned that whole &#8216;e-mail survey&#8217; thing, but now recognise it as a not-entirely-neccessary not-entirely-evil neccessary evil. Having said that, still not a huge fan :P
