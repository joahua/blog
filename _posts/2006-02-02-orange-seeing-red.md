Orange today informed us that they&#8217;ve become 3. High-powered marketing blitz to existing customers of Orange has begun, and is expected to continue in force. This line typifies the level of crap I&#8217;ve come to expect 3 (and most other 3G telephony &#8212; not data, that&#8217;s okay &#8212; networks) to spew:

> So, on our 3G network, you can enjoy the same great value, plus international roaming, Bluetoothâ„¢, picture messaging and more.

Okay. Let&#8217;s analyse this a bit. My call rates are going up, even though the volume of users on Hutchinson&#8217;s 3G network &#8220;is now larger than our CDMA network&#8221; (cost/volume should go down, but hasn&#8217;t). I could get international roaming with Orange, albeit only in places with CDMA: no-one should ever choose CDMA without being aware at least to some degree how the technology works/is applied globally (if that&#8217;s something they care about &#8212; I don&#8217;t, global roaming is still way too expensive + I don&#8217;t go overseas often enough). Bluetooth is the pinnacle of crap in this line, having absolutely nothing to do with the network &#8212; unless it&#8217;s a provider-supplied phone with Bluetooth disabled because they&#8217;re scumbags. I don&#8217;t need to elaborate on this point, suffice to say I sincerely hope no-one with any technical knowledge copy-proofed this. Picture messaging is arguably the most useless thing that ever happened to telephony.

As for the other crap HT have spun, I especially love this line from their [FAQ][2]:

What happens to my Orange contract?
:   Your Orange contract will remain valid, however, as a special offer we are allowing a full waiver of all remaining handset instalments when you upgrade to 3G.

Marvellous. Not only am I being forced onto more expensive plans + call rates (call rates matter for where I&#8217;d like to take my mobile phone usage patterns &#8212; at present, I&#8217;m price-conscious to the point of making less calls than I otherwise would, and SMS usage is trivial at 11c to any mobile in Australia. With 3 I get some free SMS, but I&#8217;m not at all helped on the call rate front), there&#8217;s also *absolutely no exit option*.

Effectively, HT would love to change my contract so I&#8217;m on a volume-economics-powered 3G network on which they have higher margins and I see no real benefits. Get this:

Can I keep my current phone when I upgrade to 3G?
:   Yes. The phone is yours to keep, however we will not be connecting any new services to Orange and this phone will not work on any other network, including our 3G network. We have developed fantastic upgrade offers that include a free handset within the plan. We are in the process of setting up a recycling program to take all old mobiles.

The phone is mine to keep, but there aren&#8217;t any CDMA networks left in Australia (WCDMA is actually nothing to do with CDMA and has no interoperability with it). &#8220;Fantastic upgrade offers&#8221; refer to marginally reduced SMS costs (which, so far as I can gather, is the most profitable part of non-business-account telephony services in Australia: namely, Orange&#8217;s core market. They never made a big impact on the business telco scene, and their flagship product &#8212; before they ditched it &#8212; was a landline-replacement plan) and increased call costs if I were to choose a plan based on my current usage. &#8220;Include a free handset&#8221; refers to the ability to get a free phone if I agree to be shunted onto a new contract term. Not terribly likely. In fact, I&#8217;m going to see *this* contract term out, then switch to another telco.

Or maybe not, but I&#8217;d certainly like to. Anyone have recommendations for a $35-40 plan, preferably with cap? Yes, even Telstra is an option if the cap is good enough. It&#8217;d mean we could get rid of our landline, still have a discount on Internet (two or more Telstra services on one bill), and switch to VoIP. Sure, Telstra are still getting our money but they&#8217;re shooting themselves in the foot doing it! I just want the family to get past the &#8220;learning curve&#8221; of VoIP so they&#8217;re hooked on the idea and then we can find a more compelling ISP, pick the cheapest possible landline rate with a non-Telstra provider, and then they&#8217;re only getting <acronym title="Unconditional Local Loop">ULL</acronym> money from us.

Did I ever mention I hate telcos?
