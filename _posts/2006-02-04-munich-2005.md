![Munich: Three men sit, Hans is dead, centre][1]

I&#8217;m trying to write about this movie (I just deleted a post and started again) and can&#8217;t do it justice. You absolutely must see it. Take tissues. It&#8217;s been described as a prayer for peace, but I see it equally as a testament to how messed up and sinful humanity is. This passed between Mathieu Kassovitz&#8217;s (*Birthday Girl; AmÃ©lie; The Fifth Element*) character, Robert, and Avner (Eric Bana &#8212; Australian. *Troy*; voice actor in *Finding Nemo; Black Hawk Down*):

> &#8220;We&#8217;re Jews, Avner. Jews don&#8217;t do wrong because our enemies do wrong.&#8221;  
> &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to be that decent anymore.&#8221;  
> &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that we ever were that decent. Thousands of years of hatred doesn&#8217;t make you decent. But we were supposed to be righteous. It&#8217;s a beautiful thing. That&#8217;s Jewish. That&#8217;s what I knew. That&#8217;s what I was taught. And now I&#8217;m losing thatâ€¦ and I lose that andâ€¦ that&#8217;sâ€¦ that&#8217;s everything. That&#8217;s my soul.&#8221;

&#8212; whilst Avner&#8217;s mother speaks of them fighting for a place&#8230; on earth. And all the while Avner is away from his child, whose voice brings him (and the audience) to tears. He speaks to his daughter afraid she won&#8217;t ever meet him/remember him, hear his voice in person.

![Munich: Avner and Daphna and daughter][2]

This is the *story* of one man and the impact all this evil had on him, beautifully (hauntingly) told. His story feels *real*. There is nothing contrived here. His wife is not a device, a catalyst for a romantic sub-plot, a draw-card for a different audience. Daphna and Avner and their child are a part of a relationship that this violence threatens to break. That is a part of what Avner is torn away from every time he plans to kill another &#8216;target&#8217;. Targets, towards the end of the film, cease to be &#8216;targets&#8217; and become people. The &#8216;safe-house&#8217;, shared with the enemy. The &#8216;local-honey trap&#8217;, murdered arbitrarily seemingly to avenge Carl&#8217;s (CiarÃ¡n Hinds &#8212; *The Phantom of the Opera; Calendar Girls; Veronica Guerin*) assassination. She is left naked, which seemingly exacerbates the depth of their actions and subsequent guilt. Hans is dead. It&#8217;s implied he was killed, though perhaps less than certain. Avner&#8217;s descent past the point of coping has begun, and an earlier allusion to someone who slept in a closet out of fear comes to fruition as Avner takes refuge in the same place. The bomb maker, Robert, dies at the hands of a ferris wheel. Any detachment from the murders of people we might once have had is now thoroughly dismissed, on both sides. The only &#8216;bias&#8217; that potentially exists stems from the perspective from which the story is told&#8230; but Spielberg is sufficiently rancorous towards the Israeli establishment &#8212; in fact, probably a little more so (could just be my reading of it: either way, it was fairly neutral, but I sympathised more &#8212; if I did &#8216;sympathise&#8217; at all &#8212; with the &#8216;opposition&#8217; in this film for whatever reason).

Go watch the movie. It&#8217;s definitely not a pleasant film, nor, at 164 minutes, is it particularly quick&#8230; but it&#8217;s worth seeing.
