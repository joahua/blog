Okay, I&#8217;ve tried it properly now. It sucks. Sure, it&#8217;s probably more usable for someone-who-really-*should*-be-using-WordPress.com-or-Blogger-or-Spaces or something, but not for anyone who&#8217;s self-hosting. Its WYSIWYG editor is doing a grave disservice to the web as a whole, the default theme, Kubrick, is a semantic thing-of-nightmares, and its AJAX administration interface fails to degrade fairly comprehensively. Yuck.

I&#8217;m using it now because I want to put something quick and dirty together, but there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m seriously considering changing anything else to WordPress 2.0.x, nor, in the future, will I consider building other sites around it. There&#8217;s one blog-only site (this is unusual: we&#8217;re not that groovy and Web 2.0 &#8212; RSS feeds seem to be an uphill battle!) we&#8217;re going to do this week at work: that can be my initial foray into [TextPattern][1].

From there, who knows (Who knows all). If I don&#8217;t like it/it&#8217;s not flexible enough (Fortunately, WordPress is rather flexible. I&#8217;m not *stuck* with it&#8217;s crappiness, I&#8217;d just prefer not to have to deal with it in the first place.), it&#8217;s probably back to the land of roll-your-own solutions again. There are a few decent-looking Rails-esque frameworks for PHP floating about out there at the minute, so I might try using one of those. Apparently Rails/Ruby is ridiculously slow compared to PHP, so I&#8217;d rather not use it and really like it and be trapped in this framework that&#8217;s very Web 2.0, very expendable, and very crap.

Can you tell I&#8217;m embittered with web (2.0) products at the minute?
