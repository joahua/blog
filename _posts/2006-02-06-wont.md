What a stupid contraction. Seriously. Will not *does not* become won&#8217;t. Show me where the &#8220;o&#8221; comes from, someone! Anyone! Etymology nerds, arise! From whence did this moronic, bastardised contraction emerge? And how do we stuff it back in a box and tape up the box and throw it overboard?

Or have I missed something, and it&#8217;s actually a perfectly sensible contraction of&#8230; something other than &#8220;will not&#8221;?
