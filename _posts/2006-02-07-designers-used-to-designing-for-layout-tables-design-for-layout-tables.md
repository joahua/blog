For the first few sites it didn&#8217;t really matter, I figured it was just getting into the swing of things. Nope.

Implementing designs that, at a glance, *feel* like table-based designs are probably built with that in mind. I can do all kinds of zany crap *Ãƒ la* various things in the [Zen Garden][1], but it doesn&#8217;t help when that [zany crap] isn&#8217;t expected. Even the One True Layout only solves so many problems&#8230; there are somethings that are easier achieved with rowspan/colspan. I&#8217;m not doing them that way, of course, but it&#8217;s just I&#8217;ve spent today agonising over how to make a not-that-complex design just work&#8230; and it&#8217;s not all falling into place as I&#8217;d like it.

Admittedly, I *am* trying to build it as a fluid layout, etc., etc., but&#8230; is there some level of CSS-design-wizardry at which all this suddenly becomes easy/straightforward?

Having said that, things are more exciting here not knowing entirely what&#8217;ll happen if you change a certain bunch of styles&#8230; which is where I&#8217;ve been for a year or so now. My CSS-wrangling isn&#8217;t anywhere *near* as bad as my JavaScript *mangling*, because I always have a very clear idea of what I want to achieve and how it&#8217;ll work when building styles&#8230; but getting there is forever an adventure!
