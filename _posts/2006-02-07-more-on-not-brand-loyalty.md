In my response-requested post of last evening, it was perhaps a little unclear what I was proposing as a state-of-the-web hypothesis.

To clarify:

1.  I believe there *may* exist a commonality of service usage within particular peer groups.
2.  This commonality *may or may not* be bound by any particular brand
3.  There is (entirely speaking from my personal experience here &#8212; hence the request for wider comment) minimal overlap between services (see 1.) within peer groups
4.  As a part of this, the chief motivator in electing a network is not the network itself or particular functionality, but rather the other &#8216;peers&#8217; the network provides access to (n.b. chief exception to this is niche services, Skype being a good example. It&#8217;s great for voice, horrible for chat, and mediocre for video. Hence, even I know a few people who have Skype accounts, they/I rarely use it/sign in unless required.)

Of these points, the most oft-acknowledged in the past is the last (See [Metcalfe&#8217;s law][1], and subsequently [Reed&#8217;s law][2]). But both of these &#8220;laws&#8221; fail to evaluate the *potential* value of a network that will, in all probability, never be realised due to competition/service fragmentation.

I&#8217;m not asserting service fragmentation is a BadThing, but I *do* believe that big service providers&#8217; [federation initiatives][3]/common standardised platforms are the *only* way forward&#8211; short of us all waiting for a monopoly to emerge&#8230; unlikely in the present climate, and improbable in the extreme in the way that [Steve desires][4] (a universal service provider environment).
