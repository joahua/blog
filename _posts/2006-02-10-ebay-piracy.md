I&#8217;m vaguely hunting for a laptop. Well, okay, a little more than vaguely&#8211;but as they&#8217;re reputedly one of the more-commonly-fraudulent items listed on eBay, use of that service as a purchasing vehicle is less than certain.

Software piracy also features&#8230; but, of course, there seems to be little that can be done to actually report this (if eBay have a &#8220;Report violation&#8221; link, it&#8217;s adequately hidden from me). Observe this question from earlier today on an iBook with OS 10.4.4 and Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign, and MS Office for Mac included:

> Me: Does this come with original CDs + licenses for OS 10.4, MS Office for Mac and Adobe software?  
> Seller: No. 

(Yeah, that was fulltext of the question + answer!)

And on another listing (I didn&#8217;t ask the question on this one!) advertised as including iLife 06, MS Office 2004 and Adobe CS2:

> Q: Are you selling the software disks too?  
> A: No. I&#8217;ve installed the software, and all the apps work, but I&#8217;m only going to be sending the laptop and its power cable. Thanks.

Sigh.

(p.s. though it may appear this way from this post, I&#8217;m not convinced I want a Mac laptop anymore. In fact, I&#8217;d probably prefer a PC because they&#8217;re lighter + cheaper than their Apple counterparts)
