Or, at least, I think they must think that everyone else thinks that they are. (Read that slowly).

A while back we filmed something and had a preview monitor underneath one of the cameras, which was pretty funny because whenever we were looking at it we appeared to be asleep (because our eyes were pointing down + eyelids followed, relative to the camera). It occurred to me on a bus today (observing someone&#8217;s eyes in a mirror overhead) that tall people must think that everyone they&#8217;re around must be constantly falling asleep, perhaps attributing it to their presence, as in other images people never look that sleepy!

Then again, maybe it&#8217;s just down to people who don&#8217;t make eye-contact enough (too-often me, as some have observed in the past!)

Shrug, struck me as being an interesting idea. Probably doesn&#8217;t actually work that way, but it&#8217;s kinda funny to think that the taller you are the more sleepy the rest of the world seems ;-)
