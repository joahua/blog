I found the perfect laptop for me. It&#8217;s cheap ($700, plus whatever it&#8217;d cost me to add wireless and 512MB of memory to it &#8212; has 256 at the minute), compact (12.1&#8243;), and insanely lightweight (3.53 pounds, which Google reliably informs me is 1.6KG).

But it&#8217;s an IBM, so it&#8217;s not an option. I didn&#8217;t realise this until after I&#8217;d got all excited over the specs and it was a shattering moment!

IBM have always epitomised appalling laptop design for me, mostly because of their insistance on a joystick as a mouse (what the HELL is with that?!) but also because of the inanity of their decision to arbitrarily change the layout of the keyboard&#8230; particularly omitting a Start key. I don&#8217;t care if I use Linux&#8230; I&#8217;ve *mapped* my start key in Ubuntu so that it works the same way! It&#8217;s a brilliant innovation (unless, of course, you&#8217;re a gamer with chunky fingers and dislike being dumped out of games&#8230; though that ceased to be a problem post-3dfx/dedicated 3D-accelleration-only cards!), and IBM have to go and ruin it for everyone. Angry angry angry.

It was such a nice laptop&#8230;
