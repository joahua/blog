This is one of those &#8220;blanket&#8221; posts that attempts to cover everything that happened (or didn&#8217;t) over the last few days. As you may have picked from the thoroughly disconnected title.

![Cricket][1]

Sunday saw a trip to the day/night cricket semi-final between Australia and Sri Lanka (I say that like I know what&#8217;s going on, but I had to ask Dad who was playing that morning. &#8217;twas purely a social thing for me!) with various friends from church.

It was pretty good times, but I managed to get burnt despite putting sunscreen on every *hour* (it was 4hr SPF30+ cream!). I think I missed part of my arms (the underside!) in the first hour, and by the second hour they&#8217;d already been sufficiently damaged to start turning bright red (it was about 2pm&#8230; yeah, easy to burn here in Oz). The Sri Lankans (spelling?) lost, but looked like they were having the most fun of anyone in the ground regardless!

So yeah, it&#8217;d rock to be Sri Lankan!

Anyway, I ate some horrendously-overpriced-sport-venue food, probably didn&#8217;t QUITE drink enough water (probably drank about 3L at the cricket alone, but was sitting in full sun, so&#8230;), and hadn&#8217;t been sleeping terribly well for the past week (or two). I&#8217;d been sticking my hand up for a few too many things some weeks back and it all finally started to come unravelled last week, I guess. Hopefully things will get better from here, we&#8217;ll see. So yeah, various factors&#8230; I got home and inside okay (albeit with a massive massive headache), went upstairs, and lost nearly everything I&#8217;d eaten that day. I got to bed but only for fourty minutes or so before I woke up again&#8230; found I apparently had more food left in my stomach! Doh.

I didn&#8217;t go to work yesterday, and spent most of the day in bed&#8230; reading Harry Potter (because I still hadn&#8217;t read book 5 and a whole day is time enough to finish pretty much any book). The headache had mostly subsided and stomach was fine by the end of the day, but I&#8217;ve got a cold now&#8230; shrug. Tis very odd. I was at work today but felt kind of lethargic + not that productive&#8230; but it was better getting some stuff done than spending another day in bed doing nothing (mind you, it would have been back to *Great Expectations* followed by *North and South* if I&#8217;d stayed home&#8230; hmm&#8230;). We&#8217;ve got a whole bunch of exciting stuff lined up for the [Sunrise Family][4] website which is getting rolled out soon, but obviously don&#8217;t waste your time looking if you don&#8217;t watch the show (I know I wouldn&#8217;t! Once various features launch I&#8217;ll probably post geeky details here&#8230; we&#8217;re looking at social media stuff especially (which shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise to those who know Yahoo!&#8217;s acquisition patterns, but seeing as 7 is very much <acronym title="Mainstream media">MSM</acronym> it&#8217;s pretty exciting), integration with products from Yahoo!&#8217;s stable, etc.

So yeah, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s been happening. Consider blogging un-slipped.
