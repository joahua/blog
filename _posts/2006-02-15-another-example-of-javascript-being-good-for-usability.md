I discovered [an article on setting focus on the next field after a selection][1] is made in a `select` option menu thingo, which looks pretty handy to have around. It *could* potentially be a bad thing, too, (if the user selected the wrong option + does repeatedly), but generally speaking this looks like a handy piece of code to have around.
