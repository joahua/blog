![Tori: sparkler in one hand, alcohol in the other][1]

Tori turned 18 yesterday and had an awesome party (even though she caught a cold the day before&#8230; apparently my fault, even though she hadn&#8217;t seen me when I was sick!). I&#8217;d post photos, but most of the half-decent ones I took are on her camera (half-decent because I can&#8217;t really ever take &#8220;party photos&#8221; with any finesse).

![Ridiculously delicious ice-cream cake][2]

There was ice-cream cake. Oh was there ice-cream cake. Yum.

\*ahem\*

Anyway, happy birthday Tori&#8230; and get un-sick soon!
