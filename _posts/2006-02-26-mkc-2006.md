![MKC 2006 -- Telling the Sermon on the Mount like it really is][1]

Spent time away at an awesomely challenging men&#8217;s convention up at Katoomba Friday night through all day Saturday, looking at the [Sermon on the Mount][2]. The two points that stuck most with me were

1.  the concept of living for an audience of one (God) in everything, and;
2.  the &#8216;unheeded&#8217; Christ, in that the influence of his teachings (so often) have ridiculously little influence on the lives of those who profess to follow him (specifically, the idea of loving enemies&#8230; our embrace of this seems to always be conditional, in that it&#8217;s very rarely loving enemies at all! Guilty of this as most people&#8230;)

I was&#8230; very impressed with the teaching and with the fellowship and everything (except that bloody keyboard that sounded as though it were from the wrong decade). &#8217;twas a great weekend, looking forward to next year!
