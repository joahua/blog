Arguably the bane of my existence (alongside JPEG logos and Home & Away DVD-cover design), Microsoft Word&#8217;s insistence on opening crap Outlook feeds it in reading-layout *can* in fact be disabled. There&#8217;s [an Office Assistance article on how to do this][1].

I hate it because it effectively presumes no-one writes documents anymore. Undermining MS Office&#8217;s awesome collaboration features (I&#8217;m being serious), etc. Not that I ever write anything in MS Office myself, of course (except for proofing stuff other people send) &#8212; but still, it bugs me. Especially the way things wrap differently, copy differently, etc. Yuck.
