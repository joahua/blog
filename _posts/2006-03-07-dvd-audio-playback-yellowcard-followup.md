[Steve][1] writes in with the following gem after my little jibe at him about [using a DVD player for CD-audio playback][2]:

> I worked with someone the other day who tried to use a DVD player for audio CDs at a show and I made them drive back to the warehouse and pick up a real CD player on the spot.
> 
> It&#8217;s just not good enough. Their insides and processing isn&#8217;t suited to reading and decoding CD audio, and they DO sound different (in a worse way).
