![Yellowcard: Lights and Sounds CD cover][1]

Stupid DRM. My computer, of course, gets around the copy protection on this CD instantly. My DVD player (which I use as a CD player: shut up Steve, CD players don&#8217;t sound a-few-hundred-dollars better, so I don&#8217;t care! ;-) ), on the other hand, can&#8217;t play the damn thing. As of right now I&#8217;m ripping it to my computer (losslessly with FLAC) and will have a prestine, non-DRM copy on a burnt CD for my use in a matter of minutes.

And if a friend ever asks if they can borrow my Yellowcard CD (bought on a whim knowing only one of their songs, I&#8217;ll add), I&#8217;ll be sure to lend them the version that works better: The one I burnt myself, without your stupid-arse software all over it.

Oh, yeah, and I&#8217;ll hesitate to purchase EMI CDs in the future. All other DRM-encumbered crap I&#8217;ve bought in the past has at least had the courtesy to work in my DVD player (this one made detection take ages, then picked it up as a VCD with wierd timecoding) &#8212; this is the barrier at which point it becomes infinitely easier to use Peer-to-Peer than buy things that look like they might be interesting in a CD store.

With physical media, I can (read: should be able to) toss it in anything and expect it to work instantly (no ripping required, etc.).

And, you know, if I wind up using Peer-to-Peer for this kind of stuff, my lossless (yeah, that&#8217;s CD quality, not MP3 junk) audio collection will be shared back with the rest of the world. Yes, even the CDs you make it harder for me to use legitimately. I *will* figure out a way to get them onto my computer (or someone else will with another CD), and I *will* use *sharing* networks if <del>scumbag</del> content providers provide me with sufficient impetus to do that.

(Incidentally, if anyone wants to borrow a non-DRM-encumbered Yellowcard CD&#8230;)
