<img src="/blog/wp-content/2006/03/em5.JPG" alt="Em" style="float:left" />Too tired for writing but feel like I should post something, so photos will have to do :-)

(Even though [Kim will probably post better photos on Flickr][1] in the next day or two!)

Karaoke&#8230;  
<img src="/blog/wp-content/2006/03/em2.JPG" alt="Karaoke" style="clear:both" />

*Bad* Karaoke&#8230; (note Matt Harris in background ;-))  
![Karaoke][2]

Obligatory crowd shot&#8230;  
![Guy, Tim, Verdo, Robin, ??, Kim, Alex][3]

More Karaoke&#8230;

Balloons! (Photos aren&#8217;t good for conveying the influence of helium ;-))  
![Helium balloons][5]

Some sibling of Em&#8217;s whose name eludes me (and cake). He was hilarious in a way that only small kids can be!

Cake (I didn&#8217;t like cupboards in the background, so this photo got a bit butchered in editing. Meh!)&#8230;  
![Cake, the important stuff][7]

It was a really good night&#8230; the karaoke definitely made it! Happy birthday Em!
