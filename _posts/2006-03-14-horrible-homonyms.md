I&#8217;m not even thinking of homonyms so much (though that *may* be true of the word in question, if you ignore similar meanings) when I get upset (as I am at present) about the untenable nature of the word &#8220;class&#8221; or &#8220;classes&#8221; (as in school/education) in any context where it could possibly be confused with programming of any sort.

As usual, it&#8217;s the geeks&#8217; fault. I suppose classes in programming generally refer to a grouping of objects, as a class of students is a grouping of the same&#8230; so perhaps context should make the distinction clearer. But still, waaaay too much potential for confusion. Roget&#8217;s was thoroughly unhelpful in this regard&#8230; &#8220;course&#8221; is inaccurate, &#8220;grade&#8221; is too broad, and everything else was way off the mark. I think I&#8217;m going to go with &#8220;course&#8221; for the minute, at least until/unless I come up with something better.

For those wondering why I&#8217;m talking about something IT-related outside of the murky realms of semantics (though this arguably relates, albeit in a different sphere!), pseudo-design/browser-bug-fighting, and my all-encompassing-JavaScript-ineptitude&#8230; well, I&#8217;m playing with [Ruby on Rails][1] again. Or rather, properly for the first time. Because, you know, I don&#8217;t think there are enough balls I&#8217;m trying to juggle already ;-) Meh. If Rails is really fast and I don&#8217;t run out of time and make this drag out forever (which I inevitably will&#8230; bleh) this&#8217;ll probably take about a month. If Rails actually sucks, which by most reports it doesn&#8217;t &#8212; speculation about crap performance for large-scale services and concern over the small bus-factor (if one dev member got hit by a bus, what&#8217;d happen to the project?) aside &#8212; then I might give up for another couple of months. Whatever!

If nothing else maybe I&#8217;ll learn some stuff about MVC along the way. Not bad for an Arts student, hey?
