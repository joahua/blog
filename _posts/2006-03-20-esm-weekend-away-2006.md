<p>This weekend just past was spent away at Springwood (lower Blue Mountains, just outside of Sydney&#8217;s boundaries) with a whole bunch of people from church, looking at a series of dinners called <em>Introducing God</em> that we&#8217;re going to be running later this year. I was a bit cynical about the scope of it and how practical talks on evangelism related to what the Bible has to say, but interesting conversations were had resultingly, so it&#8217;s all good!</p>

<p>The best part of the weekend would just be hanging out with people and taking lots of photos of insano trampoline stuff (which looked cool in real life but looks even cooler when in still frames!). The best <em>concept</em> from the actual talks, so far as I was concerned, was the idea that as we&#8217;re (i.e. Christians) brought into God&#8217;s family by Jesus, we should be a part of the &#8220;family business&#8221; &#8212; which, essentially, equates to evangelism. It&#8217;s a pretty good way of linking together our connection to God and why evangelism is an essential part of that relationship.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/joahua/sets/72057594085894389/">I took lots of photos</a> as well. And am presently trying out Flickr on a larger scale (i.e. I uploaded the weekend&#8217;s photos to Flickr to try it out, and there&#8217;s nearly 120 photos in the set).</p>
