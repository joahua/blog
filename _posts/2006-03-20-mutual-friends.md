I know I&#8217;m posting about this a fair bit lately. It&#8217;s important at the minute, I&#8217;ll stop when things settle down a bit. I&#8217;m really happy I haven&#8217;t allowed this to be/turn into an all-geek blog.

Anyway, aren&#8217;t meeting friend&#8217;s friends great? Especially when both parties have been mentioned to one another by the mutual friend, and you&#8217;re expecting to see someone you don&#8217;t-know-but-know-by-proxy at a certain place (here, a lecture/tut). It&#8217;s good because it alleviates the usual screening process people unconsciously (or consciously, I guess) do when in new groups of people, and there&#8217;s a pre-existing (implicit) degree of trust, to some extent. First steps taken care of.

Drawbacks? Well, I suppose there could be when you cease to be friends contained in one context and start to be friends outside of that initial context socially, etc., and there&#8217;s overlap with the original mutual friend&#8230; but even that depends on the nature of the relationship(s) so much that it doesn&#8217;t make sense to assert there&#8217;s anything universally bad with such relationships.

Interesting stuff to think about. Next time you&#8217;re meeting a friend&#8217;s friend in a context external to the original friend, see if you run all the usual &#8220;filters&#8221; on them as you would on anyone else unknown in the room. It&#8217;s different to sharing an interest, in that the common friend isn&#8217;t *just* a conversation catalyst (as an object, not as someone physically there starting the conversation for you) but rather a vehicle for trust. Thoughts?
