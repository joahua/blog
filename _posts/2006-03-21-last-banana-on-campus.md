I went hunting for a banana smoothie at uni today, knowing that they&#8217;d soon be unavailable (and/or ridiculously expensive) for a fairly long time in Australia (as a result of cyclones that wiped out 95% of our production and biosecurity restrictions on imports). First stop was&#8230; the place behind the dividery wall thingos downstairs at Manning, with no luck&#8230; they were all out of bananas at 10:30am! I tried BB&#8217;s over at Wentworth a couple of hours later and managed to get one from there. BB&#8217;s smoothies rock. Haven&#8217;t tried hot drinks from there yet, coz it&#8217;s too far away and the only time I feel like hot drinks is when I&#8217;m near the cart outside Fisher&#8230; but I had a bad experience with a mocha there so&#8230; yeah. Mind you, I think the person who made it wasn&#8217;t the usual guy. I&#8217;ve had better since, but am still a bit wary.

Anyway. Last banana(s). I saw one of them that went in and it looked really good&#8230; what a shame! (Yes&#8230; natural disasters have ramifications other than bananas, and that&#8217;s bad too&#8230; we&#8217;ll take that as implicit!) So yes, that was a good drink. If you want banana smoothies or muffins or whatever else banana-related go hunt them down sooner rather than later&#8230; prices/KG have already gone up by lots in shops, so it&#8217;s only going to be a matter of time before cafes and the like either stop selling them or make products with them in really expensive.

And I don&#8217;t have a &#8220;food&#8221; category to post this in. Ah well!
