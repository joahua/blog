I think we lasted 14 months. Now it&#8217;s time to switch to ADSL 2+, definitely&#8230; unless Bigpond re-quota their plans in the near future. This is just one of those things that comes with changing usage patterns. We&#8217;re still pretty average users in terms of overall bandwidth consumption (well, &#8220;pretty average&#8221; based on [Whingepool][1] w0w-0mg-my-1$p-iz-so-st1ngy-w1t-bndwdth!!Lo!L!11! users being not normal, and a presumption of &#8220;normality&#8221; for broadband being in line with Telstra&#8217;s products in Australia), but things change. I&#8217;ll stream video on the web without thinking twice now: that wouldn&#8217;t have happened anywhere near as much 18 months ago. I&#8217;m getting used to a crappy media experience in a 3&#8243; box on my 17&#8243; LCD, heh. Having said that, I&#8217;m about to go downstairs and watch an ~8&#8243; video I downloaded, on a 42&#8243; screen&#8230; and it&#8217;ll look fine! (Stupid widescreen lame-resolution/dual-link DVI-not-supported piece of junk that it is).

I&#8217;ve got a server running permanently here now, and Bigpond uploads count. That wouldn&#8217;t have mattered in the past, but I&#8217;ve pushed between 1 and 2GB of traffic from it in the last month&#8230; so it&#8217;s a contributing factor to the problem of being 800MB over quota at present.

[Exetel][2] are looking good to me at the minute (and their [Vodafone-resold mobile plans][3] look pretty awesome, too&#8230; a part of that is that they&#8217;re presented **sensibly** in a table, rather than spread across millions of pages with promotional crap &#8212; as per every large telephony provider in Australia).
