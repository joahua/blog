Wow. I haven&#8217;t been able to get here for like&#8230; a day. And it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m capped and the Internet is slow and I&#8217;m impatient, so shut up already :P

So if you can&#8217;t read this message blame a three-letter-acronym (DNS) being attacked by a four-letter-acronym (DDoS), both of which will be understood only by a small fraction of you, I guess!

Geek geek geek.

Erin&#8217;s farewell party was last night in like&#8230; Hobart or something&#8230; so a bunch of us drove down there and it was good. Or, I drove down with lots of passengers and it was a good night/trip, once we found the river under the bridge in Hobbitsville. Thanks Selo ;-) I only discovered yesterday that driving actually *can* be tiring. Or draining, one of the two. Anyway, enough about driving. I&#8217;d post photos but

a) It&#8217;d be painfully slow to upload, and;  
b) &#8230; nope, that&#8217;s about all the reason I&#8217;ve got.

It&#8217;ll happen April 1. No that&#8217;s not an April Fools&#8217; joke. Wow it&#8217;s April already. Uni calendars suck/take getting used to. I totally don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing with my life/when anymore. No diary can save me. It&#8217;s odd&#8230; I love paper but need my wall calendar and my uni diary and my home Exchange and work Exchange to all magically sync with one another. Guess it&#8217;s time to buy a cheap Palm Zire&#8230; Doh. Tempting, though. It&#8217;d save carrying lots of books for the bigger days at uni!

Stream-of-consciousness blog posts are fun. I&#8217;m going Zire shopping tomorrow I think. Well, online at least. After I fail my Greek test, and after I get home from work. We&#8217;ve got a new guy coming in tomorrow called Niels (I think? Dunno about spelling&#8230; and I have a brother called Neil so it&#8217;s not that name&#8230;) so the Australian:German ratio of our office is shifting more in favour of the Germans again. Heh. In other exciting-work-related news that probably means nothing to anyone who hasn&#8217;t seen the office, everything&#8217;s been re-arranged over the weekend. So I&#8217;m going to go in on Monday afternoon and my PC will have moved *again*. I&#8217;ve seriously had&#8230; one, two&#8230;. two and a half different desks/desk locations since I started last December! (Or was it November?) Change is good fun.

I haven&#8217;t posted on Ï„ÏÎ±Î½ÏƒÎ»Î¹Ï„ÎµÏÎ±Ï„Î¹Î¿Î½ this week, have I? Probably not. Badness. I am constantly thinking about that stupid subject, it&#8217;s just that real work for it eludes me. Mark quipped this evening that he shouldn&#8217;t have done two subjects in a semester he actually wanted to do well in. I think I find myself agreeing! Hehe. I&#8217;m really excited about our first English assessment, even if it is a paltry 1000 words and so on. Just to write academically again. And I know the HSC year wasn&#8217;t about that but I tried to make it that anyway &#8230; hence my English Advanced teacher saying to me she didn&#8217;t think I could get a band 6. A comment on arrogance, perhaps, but I love that subject too much to just let things go and regurgitate. Unlike Emily I don&#8217;t just enjoy the idea of languages&#8230; they&#8217;re genuinely interesting (irrespective of whether or not I actually study them &#8212; I read this great bi-lingual English/Spanish culture blog that&#8217;s pretty random but just occasionally has absolute gems of information/new perspectives) in their complexities, irrationalities, quirks, and associated cultures. Intertexuality is great, too.

Tonight in church we were doing the last bit of Mark chapter 7, and there&#8217;s this bit that says &#8220;He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him &#8220;Ephphatha&#8221; (which means, &#8220;Be opened!&#8221;).&#8221; &#8212; and I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder &#8220;why not translate that word?&#8221;. Turns out it actually says Î¿ ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½ Î´Î¹Î±Î½Î¿Î¹Ï‡Î¸Î·Ï„Î¹, which apparently translates as &#8220;which is &#8220;Be opened!&#8221;&#8221; or similar. ÎµÏ†Ï†Î±Î¸Î± is actually an Aramaic word (I don&#8217;t know what characters Aramaic uses, even, let alone how to transliterate that back!) that just happened to be rendered in Greek in the original. So we&#8217;re actually getting the undoctored version in the Bible, even though it&#8217;d be simpler to translate &#8220;ephphatha&#8221; as &#8220;be opened!&#8221; and just skip that step. Good stuff.

Speaking of all that Greek, I should go sleep so I have time tomorrow to learn three weeks&#8217; worth of vocab for a test at midday. Yay.
