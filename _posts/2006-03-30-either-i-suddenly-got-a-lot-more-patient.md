&#8230; or Telstra&#8217;s capping system just stopped working. I like.

<ins datetime="2006-03-30T06:23:48+00:00">Update: We&#8217;re now at 11593.49 MB usage, but everything&#8217;s back to normal speeds. The IP changed for some reason&#8230; so it seem as though it&#8217;s maybe an IP-based restriction validated every X hours &#8212; and we&#8217;re not yet at that revalidation point, I suppose. Interestingness. Shrug, it&#8217;s nearly April!</ins>
