I missed the fastest bus trip to-from Sydney Uni I&#8217;ve ever been on today. Well, slept through it (actually *good* sleep, which is weird for *anyone* on public transport, I think!) and woke up perfectly-timed at the stop before mine. The whole thing took twenty minutes, which is pretty awesome. More awesome in light of the fact that I didn&#8217;t have to wait for a bus. My last lecture finished at 4 and I was home by 4.30. Eggcellent.

Ah, and no, I don&#8217;t often sleep on that bus&#8230; I just didn&#8217;t get to bed until particularly late coz I got to speak to Katy/yana/kt/how-many-other-names? for the first time in aaaagggeeeesss, so yeah. That was cool. Excited to know she&#8217;s alive and stuff! ;-) It was suggested that blogs are a great way of judging people&#8217;s existence. So Katy should get a blog happening. On which she would whinge about many things, as that is the pivotal aspect of the genre &#8212; note this is the first comprehensive definition of what exactly a &#8220;blog&#8221; entails that seems to adequately match&#8230; well, most blogs I read. Good stuff!
