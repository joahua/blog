Well, turns out last month&#8217;s HTTP bandwidth usage wound up at around 3.75GB. Coolness. It recently occurred to me that I don&#8217;t particularly have any &#8220;Slashdot-me&#8221; ambitions for this blog at present, but it&#8217;s still fun watching the numbers increase every month for no apparent reason! Except, perhaps, &#8216;the plebs&#8217; catching up with my occasional open-source trendiness ;-) Or something&#8230; probably more of the &#8216;something&#8217;. Heh.

120,000 hits and nearly 7,500 unique visitors to this site last month were served 56,000 pages by Dale&#8217;s [metro][1] FreeBSD server&#8230; heh, from one of the most serious-looking home server setups I know of. Still, &#8216;consumer-grade&#8217; though it may be, it&#8217;s doing rather well! Technology is fun ;-)
