<p>We aren&#8217;t hearing this every day, it&#8217;s not making lead headlines. It&#8217;s buried amongst other stories.</p>
<blockquote><p>More than 200,000 people died in the [Boxing Day] tsunami but that toll will be dwarfed by the disaster that is about to engulf Africa.</p>
<p>However, unlike the tsunami it will not be a single, photogenic disaster to lure the world&#8217;s media. The arid lands will wreak a slower carnage.</p>
<p>So far, its victims are attracting a tiny fraction of the charity. And yet, unlike the tsunami, this disaster came with plenty of warning.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it got published. Listen&#8230;</p>
