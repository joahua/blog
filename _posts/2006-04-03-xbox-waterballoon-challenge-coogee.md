[Xbox waterballoon challenge @ Coogee][1] is going to be awesome. Twenty bucks for $150 worth of Xbox gear (guess they&#8217;re figuring people like me might actually buy an Xbox because of it &#8212; heh, more likely stuff&#8217;ll wind up on Ebay!), and you get to throw waterballoons at random strangers. What&#8217;s not to like?

April 22nd, 10am-1pm. They deserve viral marketing for this one, it&#8217;s bizarre enough!
