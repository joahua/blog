There is no ownership of ideas. Common sense calls for attribution (which DVC gave anyway!), but an idea is ephemeral in the mind of one person alone: growth beyond that is required for it to survive. If ideas are of value (one presumes that they are), any notion of exclusivity is ludicrous and devaluing.

I am not, therefore, an irrational communist in this regard. I acknowledge value, but simply reject that same value is decreased by propagation/increase in supply/availability. Hence, I am an irrational capitalist.
