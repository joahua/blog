I am procrastinating so hard right now. All I&#8217;ve gotta do is write a measly 500 words for an essay plan and it&#8217;s just so not happening. So I&#8217;m cropping and rotating photos. Have some cool sky.

And a pyramid rope thingy that looks like it&#8217;s on fire.

And a freaking huge piece of Jaeger Schnitzel.

We all ate way too much that night&#8230; the Schnitzel developed its own identity (or became a certain someone&#8217;s baby&#8230;) and much strangeness was had by all.

Slowly playing catch-up with content, here! Heh. I haven&#8217;t got time for Flickr I&#8217;ve decided&#8230; it needs to fill in descriptions for you as well! What is this Web 2.0 crap? I want omniscient AI already: it knows everything about my photos so I don&#8217;t have to. I&#8217;d pay for that&#8230;
