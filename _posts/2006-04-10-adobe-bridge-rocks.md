It&#8217;s just great organising software. I doubt I&#8217;d pay for it on its own, but seeing as it comes with CS there&#8217;s nothing much wrong with it. At a pinch, it can also be used for slide shows (for weird corporates like AMP that ship Adobe CS but have held back their MS Office to &#8217;97! Hence, there&#8217;s no PowerPoint &#8220;insert photos&#8221; wizard, and on Win 2k there&#8217;s no picture and fax viewer that does slideshows.)
