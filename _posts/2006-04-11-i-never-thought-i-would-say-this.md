> The In-Class Test for Classical Mythology scheduled for 12 noon on Wednesday 12 April has been postponed to 12 noon Wednesday 26 April 2006 (in General Lecture Theatre, Main Quad).
> 
> The NTEU has today requested its academic members not to penalise students for missing classes in order to attend the VSU rally at 12 noon on Wednesday 12 April. In view of this request, the department of Classics and Ancient History has agreed that the test be postponed.
> 
> We regret any inconvenience caused. Please contact me (email.suppressed@arts.usyd.edu.au) if this decision has caused problems for you. Also please note that as the rescheduled test will be held in university teaching time we cannot accept work or social engagements as valid excuses for not attending the test at the rescheduled time.

Thank you, SRC!

(For the record, I don&#8217;t mind the USU at all&#8230; at present I&#8217;d possibly even pay fees next year! The SRC&#8217;s political agenda is a little vomit-worthy most of the time&#8230; but I may go get a free lunch from them on Wednesday. ;-))
