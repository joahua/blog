[This article][1] is actually pretty impressive (for a left-wing, secular publication) in the views it presents. Well, I say this because I agree largely with what&#8217;s said (and didn&#8217;t expect I would). Nathan Tasker is definitely on the mark:

> [...] He&#8217;s cautious about labelling the trend a &#8220;revival&#8221; because an emphasis on numbers can miss the point. &#8220;I see the shift in numbers. I see a rise in youth going to church. I see youth groups trying to respond to that by being culturally relevant. But **sometimes they end up being culturally irrelevant because they forget what makes them true**.&#8221; [...] &#8220;I sometimes wonder if our church growth might be just because it&#8217;s another thing you can add to your list. For every person who&#8217;s singing along in genuine worship, there&#8217;s always another one who **sees it as the next cool thing to do**. Spirituality becomes today&#8217;s atheism; it&#8217;s just as narcissistic.&#8221;

I&#8217;m vaguely surprised this got published, actually. An interesting read.
