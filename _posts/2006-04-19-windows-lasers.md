![Crashing computer in window of a day surgery][1]

I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d trust my cosmetic surgery (which, you know, I have done so regularly) to a place that have lasers and crashing computers&#8230; note the message on the screen: &#8220;&#8230;Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.&#8221; Oh yeah? What about my arm!?!

Pew, pew! Lasers!
