Wow. This is seriously the slowest machine EVAR. I presume it&#8217;s not just this one, and hence conclude: Mac Minis suck when it comes to burning DVDs (or any task that actually involves much processing power, for that matter!) It is somewhat redeemed by Apple&#8217;s software&#8217;s comparative speed, but when it comes down to quantifiable tasks like burning a disc&#8230; yeah, it&#8217;s crap.
