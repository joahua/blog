<p>Now <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/joahua/sets/72057594117775868/" title="Gem's 18th">a photoset on Flickr</a>, which seems to work well for this high-volume kinda stuff. I just bought me a Pro account (because I would have done the normal limit ten times over when I clicked &#8220;Upload&#8221; last night)&#8230; that&#8217;s two they&#8217;ve got out of me thus far. Flickr rocks.</p>
<p>As, incidentally, did our costumes:</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/joahua/135369255/in/set-72057594117775868/"><img src="/blog/wp-content/2006/04/135369255_8e230c742f.jpg" alt="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" /></a></p>
<p>And the lighting rig!</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/joahua/135438730/in/set-72057594117775868/"><img src="/blog/wp-content/2006/04/135438730_65eb0372a3.jpg" alt="Lights, crowd dancing" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/joahua/135482723/in/set-72057594117775868/"><img src="/blog/wp-content/2006/04/135482723_d2532b45ec.jpg" alt="Lights, crowd dancing" /></a></p>
<p>And the strange looks we attracted at about 1am&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/joahua/135484826/in/set-72057594117775868/"><img src="/blog/wp-content/2006/04/135484826_889fcfc3de.jpg" alt="Aftermath... another visit to McDonald's" /></a></p>
<p>(Yeah, that&#8217;s McDonalds).</p>
