We&#8217;re too old but went anyway. Was a good weekend even though we didn&#8217;t go to all the sessions (or perhaps better?) &#8212; though I was impressed with the quality of teaching by both Stuart White + Tim Bowden. Less so with other aspects of the whole thing, but that was my experience two years ago as well, so nothing unexpected/sufficiently cautious approach for it not to be immediately harmful (Katy expressed similar concerns and was also critically approaching &#8212; in an active way &#8212; everything that was going on. So it&#8217;s not just me :P).

Anyway, [there are photos up on Flickr][1] (which I uploaded overnight because we were at 9.8GB usage for the month and it resets this morning! Yeah!). Mostly just of us being pyros when someone said they wanted a bonfire. And some of Nintendo on a projector. Heh, geekage.
