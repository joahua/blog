I was contending with the first example image below (left) this week. Why on earth does a crimp connector need SIX SEPARATE PIECES??

Pin, connector, sleeve. You don&#8217;t need two washers (rubber, metal) and a part-conical metal ring to crimp something in place. WES components sent it to us and I&#8217;m so convinced they must have sent the wrong thing because I have absolutely no idea how anything is meant to crimp into place inside that thing. There isn&#8217;t even a sleeve to crimp. There&#8217;s a screw-on connector that does absolutely NOTHING for cable tension. Utterly useless. And you can&#8217;t crimp the barrel because there&#8217;s a die-cast metal screw inside it, isn&#8217;t there. And even if you had enough strength/a big enough crimp tool to manage that, all you&#8217;d succeed in doing would be crushing things and the connection would suck. I say this having tried on the part-cone which proceeded to quite literally shatter into fragments. Wow I love crimp tools, they exert so much force without appearing to, it&#8217;s hilarious!

But, whilst speaking of cables, [Madison Technologies][3] get a good rap. They&#8217;re cost effective and ridiculously fast with their turnarounds (regrettably so fast they wouldn&#8217;t wait for a courier, insisting on sending their own &#8212; but it was less than quoted, so that&#8217;s not so bad). Uhh, they do custom cables amongst other things. Good stuff. Ordered late Friday afternoon, the guy said he&#8217;d do it first thing Monday, and it was despatched by before lunchtime (which was when I called to give them our courier details, only to discover someone had already left!) Awesome service.
