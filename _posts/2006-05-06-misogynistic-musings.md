As Selo discovered, KrÃ¤mer may have written in a manual for inquisitors RE: witchcraft, &#8220;What else is woman but a foe to friendship, an inescapable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted with fair colors!&#8221;, but 120 years later Shakespeare exceeded him (though, it must be said, in a work of comedy considered &#8212; perhaps &#8212; to be self-parodic in relation to his earlier works):

> *POSTHUMUS*.  
> Is there no way for men to be, but women  
> Must be half-workers? We are all bastards,  
> And that most venerable man which I  
> Did call my father was I know not where  
> When I was stamp&#8217;d. Some coiner with his tools  
> Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seem&#8217;d  
> The Dian of that time. So doth my wife  
> The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!  
> Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain&#8217;d,  
> And pray&#8217;d me oft forbearance; did it with  
> A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on&#8217;t  
> Might well have warm&#8217;d old Saturn; that I thought her  
> As chaste as unsunn&#8217;d snow. O, all the devils!  
> This yellow Iachimo in an hour- was&#8217;t not?  
> Or less!- at first? Perchance he spoke not, but,  
> Like a full-acorn&#8217;d boar, a German one,  
> Cried &#8220;O!&#8217; and mounted; found no opposition  
> But what he look&#8217;d for should oppose and she  
> Should from encounter guard. Could I find out  
> The woman&#8217;s part in me! For there&#8217;s no motion  
> That tends to vice in man but I affirm  
> It is the woman&#8217;s part. Be it lying, note it,  
> The woman&#8217;s; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;  
> Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;  
> Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,  
> Nice longing, slanders, mutability,  
> All faults that man may name, nay, that hell knows,  
> Why, hers, in part or all; but rather all;  
> For even to vice  
> They are not constant, but are changing still  
> One vice but of a minute old for one  
> Not half so old as that. I&#8217;ll write against them,  
> Detest them, curse them. Yet &#8217;tis greater skill  
> In a true hate to pray they have their will:  
> The very devils cannot plague them better. *[Exit]*
