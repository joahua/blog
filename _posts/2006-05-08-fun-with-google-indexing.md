I&#8217;ve got 8,480 images under this domain, according to [Google Image Search][1]. You&#8217;re limited to 50 pages of image matches I think (1000 images, 20 per page), but it&#8217;s still good to get an overall impression of the amount of graphical content on a domain. Mine is slightly biased because of [year12.joahua.com][2]. [Without it][3], I&#8217;ve still got a rather-solid 3,760 images online (so, on/associated with this blog, basically).
