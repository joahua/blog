As if this server wasn&#8217;t [pushing enough traffic][1] per day already (this site is generally 100MB/day of what you&#8217;ll see on that graph, plus spider traffic), I finally got around to sitting down and fixing the broken stuff about [the gallery here][2]. Well, okay, Ben did most of the fixing. I changed some URI structures/added some rules so that old permalinks start working again. Anyway, point is, all the old stuff is working again now. Not that this probably affects many/any of you who read blog stuff, unless you&#8217;re feeling nostalgic. Shrug :)

I&#8217;m now of mixed mind as to where to upload more photos. Flickr is fun + makes editing metadata easily + I&#8217;ve paid for it for a year. But here is stable + I have complete control and&#8230; blah blah blah&#8230; it&#8217;s not owned by Yahoo! (yet ;-) err I mean&#8230; \*cough\*)

Ah well. Flickr API&#8217;s make it easy to pull data out quick + easily. So conceivably it&#8217;d be not too hard to write something to &#8220;export&#8221; to cat-scan. Maybe by this time next year&#8230;
