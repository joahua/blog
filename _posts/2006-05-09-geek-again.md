I know I&#8217;ve made posts like this before, but it feels neccessary to keep doing so such that the strangeness of such occurences may continue to be acknowledged.

Picked up a page of scribbled notes, and mentally reached for Ctrl + F. I realised it wasn&#8217;t possible, but the *reason* I didn&#8217;t think it possible was because it was too messy for OCR. So&#8230; OCR is now being performed with searches on random physical objects. Weird geeks&#8230;
