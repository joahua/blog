Four new spam messages every 3 minutes isn&#8217;t a good thing for me when trying to get more assessments done without having left enough time, especially as I can&#8217;t stand to see things stay in the mod queue. I would absolutely beat the crap out of whatever computer is running a job to send this stuff right about now. And probably the guy who scheduled the job, come to that. Grrr.

Die evil spammers!
