I really enjoy writing things to be read aloud. I really don&#8217;t enjoy having to make them fit into time constraints. It&#8217;s different to normal essay writing because there&#8217;s always the temptation to just write more and try and say it faster. Or go really close to what you know the limit is going to be and hope you don&#8217;t stumble over too many words/need to pause for breath. Speaking itself is actually exciting. Slowly getting used to it. I think I actually almost like the sound of my own voice now, at least in my head (writing &#8211; I think in full sentences, apparently that&#8217;s not something everyone does. It&#8217;s why if I&#8217;m thinking aloud I have a tendancy to rephrase things a couple of times. And/or embarrass myself by arguing over the semantics of a word/reconstructing a sentence.). Invariably, things sound dumber when they&#8217;re actually spoken. Ah well.
