![Rainbow across a yellow sky][1]

(taken yesterday, late afternoon)

> &#8220;Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.&#8221;

How great is God?

[Barney&#8217;s][2] on Broadway burnt to the ground yesterday, which must be so horrible for people who have memories associated with/in that building&#8230; but, despite that, it&#8217;s just a building. So thankful that everyone I&#8217;ve spoken to who goes there understands that. It&#8217;s so encouraging to see faith that is centered in God&#8217;s unchanging word + Jesus.

Thanks to God that his church will never be destroyed!

For those who are a part of Barney&#8217;s, know you&#8217;re in much prayer, especially at the minute.
