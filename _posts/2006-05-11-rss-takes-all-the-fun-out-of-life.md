Well, it doesn&#8217;t really. In fact, RSS is great. (Even if Atom is better, but more people know what RSS is so I&#8217;m using that loosely for &#8220;feed&#8221;/syndication generally).

It&#8217;s mostly good because I never kept a list of favourite sites, and visiting/remembering to visit wherever totally takes up too much of my time/just doesn&#8217;t happen. It&#8217;s bad because some things don&#8217;t support RSS&#8230; but I don&#8217;t really read anything like that. The exception, of course, being LJ comment feeds which DON&#8217;T EXIST. It&#8217;s annoying how they can be so advanced/innovative with their OpenID stuff, etc., but so backwards in not providing what is (for every other blog service on the planet) par for the course. Actually, I lie. I think Blogger equally sucks in that regard, but whatever. They shouldn&#8217;t.

Having said all that, RSS takes away from the, erm, thrill of the chase. You can&#8217;t go looking at &#8220;just one more site&#8221; because they&#8217;re all defined in a list, and aggregated for you in one place! Terrible for procrastination. Ah well. Very little of that still required! (Until exams loom closer, that is).
