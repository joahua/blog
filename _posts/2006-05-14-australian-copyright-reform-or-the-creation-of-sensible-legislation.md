Woot. The best bit:

> Schools, universities, libraries and other cultural institutions will in the future be free to use copyright material for non-commercial purposes.

Dubious bit:

> In a big win for recording artists, the laws will include the removal of the legislative 1 per cent cap on copyright licence fees paid by radio broadcasters for playing sound recordings.

Dubious because I&#8217;m really uncertain as to how that&#8217;s going to pan out&#8230; I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s actually going to further inhibit the scope of the music we hear on commercial radio! Non-commercial radio&#8230; well, who knows? Is that a &#8220;cultural institution&#8221;?

We&#8217;ll see how it pans out. I&#8217;m now keen on getting an MP3 player/phone that plays MP3s (and has at least 512MB on an SD card, none of this super-tiny-memory stuff you find in phones). Orange stop operations at the beginning of August, I think, so I&#8217;ve got until then&#8230;
