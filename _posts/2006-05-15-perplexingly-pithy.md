I&#8217;ve never really gotten away with one-liners on this blog. It&#8217;s weird. A large part of that is because I&#8217;m an old windbag that doesn&#8217;t know how to write a sentence without a ridiculous number of clauses, but&#8230; the proof is in the pudding; they should all lead somewhere and make more sense more clearly than shorter sentences would. It&#8217;s about me not trusting you, dear reader, to have half a brain for yourself and understand what I am saying. I imagine that, by speaking (that is what characterises this medium of blogging more than anything else &#8212; as with instant messenging, it is more about an ongoing conversation than a protracted series of epistles) more, I leave less to chance, less chance of misunderstanding, misinterpretation.

And I find this to be true of most other blogs I have perused in the past, with the obvious exception of completely simple statements/one-line commentaries to be found on posts that consist solely of a link to another site, and a summary comment/quip. Those aren&#8217;t blogs, though, they&#8217;re link-logs. Or whatever you&#8217;re going to call them.

Finally, I&#8217;m engaging with [LJ][1] people and am increasing perplexed as to how one is expected to interact in such an environment. All is normal, mundane, drawing a-heck-of-a-lot-of-comments; then there is a pebble (it is only a pebble) dropped onto the placid surface of a tightly strung membrane, pulled taut by dozens of interactors (commenters) who play a role in the blog context. It bounces.

Crack.

I picture it like ice, because that&#8217;s a dramatic image that appeals to me&#8230; shards, stress-fractures, moving across its surface at incredible speed. It&#8217;s not really like that, however. The surface is simply released from the edges. It&#8217;s like those parachute games you&#8217;d play as a kid&#8230; imagine people letting go of the edges &#8212; the pebble, or author (actually in my original metaphor it was the author&#8217;s pithy-one-liner post: either analog will suffice), is left in the middle beneath sheets of canvas.

Perhaps I misconstrue the response. Even beneath that canvas there is, perhaps (again), a subterranean response that goes unseen &#8212; that is, email, phone calls, SMS, IM conversations&#8230; I speak of an electronic communciations ecosystem only, for it perplexes me to think that anyone could or would use a letter to deal with such things: this, however, betrays my personal context: I am male and no longer at an age where I encounter my closest friends at school everyday.

But, it appears, this pebble bounces and causes those who were active to fall silent. Respectful.

That&#8217;s how I feel about it. That&#8217;s how I *excuse* it in myself.

As an alien, it is not my duty to respond&#8230; it would be inappropriate, engaging too much, likely to attract disdain, scorn. So afraid we are of being seen to reach out.

And I can&#8217;t help but wonder what would happen if I were to start posting the same kinds of one-liners I see all over those kinds of very-age-specific social networks, here. Would something explode, scaring all commenters away? I like to think I mix it up enough here that I scare everyone away equally&#8230; or rather, there are occasionally things that will interest all, but I have somehow managed to free myself from the constraints of writing for an audience. This is post 966, by the way. That&#8217;s developed writing&#8230; not good writing, just developed. Hopefully as I do so more I&#8217;ll understand the medium better&#8230; for me, yeah, there is a medium. Blogging is not useless (anymore).

Even LiveJournal is useful in its own (different to this) way&#8230; it&#8217;s chiefly social. That&#8217;s the thing about hosted services over DIY jobs. DIY jobs are the best. Yeah, WordPress counts as DIY. The point is, there&#8217;s no social facilitator in place. This isn&#8217;t Facebook or MySpace or LiveJournal. It doesn&#8217;t have any hooks into them (exception: LJ&#8217;s awesome OpenID is delegated to from this page), there&#8217;s no way to build links. I&#8217;m still an outsider technically, if not otherwise&#8230; LJ blow-in that I am and have been. But they&#8217;re outsiders, too. They&#8217;re outside every other social network on the planet. It&#8217;s *that* which I find most striking about social networks&#8230; they *continue* to facilitate fragmentation! Each cries out, &#8220;join our clique!&#8221; &#8230; and they often do.

Some are using Blogger, or even (MSN) Spaces. There are no social networking hooks between services. None of that group of friends uses RSS: they&#8217;re still manually checking (if, indeed, they do) these blogs. No convenient index-login-screen to say friends have posted new things. No attention-drawn to pithy one-liners to be ignored (or responded to in some hidden way?) The whole situation is utterly perplexing. And now I feel how I imagine a sociology student must.
