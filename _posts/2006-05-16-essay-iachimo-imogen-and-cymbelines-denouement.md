<blockquote><p>Your daughter&#8217;s chastity&#8212;there it begins.<br />
He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams<br />
And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,<br />
Made scruple of his praise, and wager&#8217;d with him<br />
Pieces of gold &#8216;gainst this which then he wore<br />
Upon his honour&#8217;d finger, to attain<br />
In suit the place of&#8217;s bed, and win this ring<br />
By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,<br />
No lesser of her honour confident<br />
Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;<br />
And would so, had it been a carbuncle<br />
Of Phoebus&#8217; wheel; and might so safely, had it<br />
Been all the worth of&#8217;s car. Away to Britain<br />
Post I in this design. Well may you, sir,<br />
Remember me at court, where I was taught<br />
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference<br />
&#8216;Twixt amorous and villainous.</p></blockquote>
<p>V. iv. 179-95.</p>
<p>Iachimo&#8217;s exposition of his past actions in this, the closing scene of Cymbeline, is a crucial component of  the play: we observe a complex narrative approach its  closure, a dÃ©nouement of which Imogen is (perhaps not  insignificantly) catalyst. It is the idea of wronged  Imogen that drives this earlier part of Iachimo&#8217;s  confession &#8212; it should be observed, however, that it  is not only he who should bear responsibility for  wronging her.</p>
<p>Outside of this passage, Iachimo asserts the propriety  and nobility of Posthumus, declaring from line 158: &#8221; What should I say? he was too good to be/Where ill men  were, and was the best of all/Amongst the rar&#8217;st of  good ones&#8212;sitting sadly,/Hearing us praise our loves  of Italy/For beauty, that made barren the swell&#8217;d  boast/Of him that best could speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>His praise of the man whom he had earlier proven hasty,  jealous, and in many other ways imprudent (cf.  Posthumus&#8217; hysterical, misogynistic tirade in II. v.)  feels, without doubt, ironic. In the context of this  play such irony should appear humorous &#8212; it is,  afterall, categorised as comedy &#8212; yet one must surely  (at the least) consider this as a deeper expression of  Iachimo&#8217;s repentance. His own assertions of the chastity  of Imogen against even that of mythological paragon of  virtue, DianaOne must presume this is what Shakespeare means by &#8220;Dian&#8221; , the contraction being purely for metrical purposes.  Ambiguity at this point is introduced, as in Celtic  Mythology there is, in fact, a figure known as Dian Cecht.  He is, however, associated with craftsmanship and  healing: Roman Diana/Greek Artemis&#8217; perpetual virginity  is clearly a better (more logical) fit. , serve to exacerbate his own deeds; perhaps in a  manner considered humourous.</p>
<p>There appear to be recurrent congruencies between the  perceived competency of Posthumus as lover and as  leader throughout the playIn line with both Judeo-Christian conceptions of the  role of a husband as leader of his wife, as valued by  the society of that time; but also in the renewed  ideals identified as essential for the &#8220;Renaissance man&#8221;. , and Iachimo&#8217;s speech here serves to further this conception.  It is his lovers&#8217; praise, for which Iachimo professes  himself &#8220;wretch&#8221; having held scorn towards, that (at  least in part) plays towards Iachimo&#8217;s address of  Posthumus as &#8220;He, true knight&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thus, the two principle concerns of this work are found  combined, inextricable from one another. From the  beginning, Iachimo is a trickster, debased: his  scandalous nature defined by his role as seducer and accuser.  Such it is that themes of relationship (not romance)  and jealousy &#8212; not confined to a marital context &#8212;  are first drawn out. The folk-tale figure of an evil  step-mother is the first jealous character met; though,  perhaps, one may identify her jealousy as coming after  the jealous love of a father towards her daughter.  However, one is not necessarily disposed to considering  Cymbeline a particularly great ruler; his own absent  children are a possible reflectionI. i. 64-65 of uncertain  continuity of the royal line, surely a poor way to be  in the eyes of an audience aware of the need for  stability in terms of monarchical successors.</p>
<p>Irrespective as to who was first jealous  chronologically, it seems clear that there are two  types of jealousy in this play; the first, it appears,  is political. Jealousy, even in the political sense, is  intrinsically bound up with children and the notion of  inheritance: such is the nature of monarchy. The  audience witness an evil step-mother, fighting to place  her own successor to the throne in first position.  Betwixt her poisoning, scheming and subversion,  Posthumus and Imogen are wed; Posthumus is banished by  a father jealous not so much of his love, but of his  nobility and presumption such that a man could be  worthy of the King&#8217;s natural daughter. Cloten, though an  ignorant fool, similarly exhibits jealous qualities;  they are his end.</p>
<p>Iachimo, then, is driven by what? His own jealousy is  one of the few not tied up in relationship; he desires  not &#8220;hers and mine adultery&#8221; &#8212; but to win the ring! Yet,  despite this, his story beings with &#8220;Your daughter&#8217;s chastity&#8221;.  The idea of unfounded jealousy pervades even Iachimo&#8217;s  comic greed; his devices cunning, his manner crafty,  his influence deceptive. This is no Midsummer Night&#8217;s  Dream, and Iachimo is no Puck. It is striking that,  though this be called comedy, it is oft closer to a  rapidly-executed tragedy with a great deal less  introspection, and a fair number of additional subplots.</p>
<p>As Posthumus&#8217; cooler-than-Dian wife, Imogen, was  catalyst for a large portion of this work&#8217;s plot (with  the exception of the &#8220;pure&#8221; politics regarding Rome&#8230; and  even that is used to bring Belarius, Polydore, Cadwal,  and numerous others &#8212; including Posthumus &#8212; back into  the flow of the text such that all may be bound  together in conclusion), she is also catalyst for its dÃ©nouement.  Imogen chooses to question Iachimo, bringing his story  to light. He speaks favourably of Posthumus in the  earlier parts of his story; and is interrupted by  Posthumus himself before his discourse progresses to  Posthumus&#8217; inflamed response.</p>
<p>As it stands, this is the pivotal point upon which all  the story&#8217;s threads are brought to closure. Imogen&#8217;s  apparently didactic influence upon Iachimo (&#8220;where I was  taught/Of your chaste daughter the wide  difference/&#8217;Twixt amorous and villanous.&#8221;) may have had  little impact upon his actions of the time &#8212; indeed,  it feels as though such a declaration even at this  point of the play may be to appease a king who may  attribute the loss of his daughter to such actions,  were Iachimo to get to the conclusion of his story  before Posthumus&#8217; arrival.</p>
<p>Such it is that the narrative is rapidly sketched, and  the King appears utterly perplexed. This fantastical  series of events that so befits a romance defuses  anger, delays judgement, and results in reconciliation  of all concerned &#8212; with the obvious exception of  villains slain in valorous manner by undiscovered sons.</p>
<p>Valour, too, is key to Iachimo&#8217;s speech. As alluded to  earlier, Posthumus is addressed as &#8220;true knight&#8221;. The  audience is not under any illusions as to the character  of Posthumus, having witnessed his outburst of II. v.  and observed his somewhat-sulky behaviour for the  following two (nearly three) acts. It hardly appears as  though he is particularly true &#8212; that is, having faith  in his wife&#8217;s chastity in his absence &#8212; or valorous,  having spent most of the play lamenting (some would say  wallowing) in his own stupidity: first at having  married and been deceived, fallen for one of those who  are the embodiment of every kind of vice:II. v. 20-28</p>
<blockquote><p>For there&#8217;s no motion<br />
That tends to vice in man but I affirm<br />
It is the woman&#8217;s part. Be it lying, note it,<br />
The woman&#8217;s; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;<br />
Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;<br />
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,<br />
Nice longing, slanders, mutability,<br />
All faults that man may name, nay, that hell knows,<br />
Why, hers, in part or all; but rather all</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, at having ordered her assassination (notably, he  does not kill her himself &#8212; one is, it would seem,  encouraged not consider a man of such effeminate  outbursts as the histrionics of II. v. capable of such  a deed), he spake thus:V. i. 7-11</p>
<blockquote><p>Gods! if you<br />
Should have ta&#8217;en vengeance on my faults, I never<br />
Had liv&#8217;d to put on this; so had you saved<br />
The noble Imogen to repent, and struck<br />
Me, wretch more worth your vengeance.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, Posthumus is not of a greatly valorous appearance.  His character in this tragicomedy invokes both  Othello&#8217;s jealous violence, and escapes Romeo and  Juliet&#8217;s tragic suicide upon thinking one another dead,  yet as military hero he is no Othello; as lover, no Romeo.</p>
<p>Yet, despite all this, Iachimo&#8217;s praise of him to the  audience is pleasant, if not true. Whilst Imogen is as  faultless Diana, Posthumus forms, with her, the marital  relationship that directs the action of this play. It  would be deeply dissatisfying for the couple to fail in  this process of &#8220;untangling&#8221;.</p>
<p>This passage of Iachimo&#8217;s speech is clearly one from a  work that is not devoted to tragedy. Iachimo presents a &#8221; true knight&#8221; such that romantic (as in relational,  distinct from &#8220;romance&#8221;) expectations may be fulfilled  upon the restoration of Imogen and Posthumus as a couple.  From that perspective, Iachimo&#8217;s speech is essential.  The apparent falsehood of elements of his speech is  entirely excusable: his story is a segway into Imogen&#8217;s  own, which in turn introduces Guiderius and Arviragus  &#8212; the two who are, from the outset, destined for leadership.</p>
<p>The audience is aware of Posthumus&#8217; unsuitability for  such a role; all Iachimo&#8217;s speech achieves is a  restoration of him such that there is an inherent  satisfaction at the restoration of their marriage.  Iachimo&#8217;s role is as disqualifier and restorer, as he  clears way for the ascension of the true heirs to the  throne, whilst &#8212; through a discourse perhaps gently  biased &#8212; finally uniting Posthumus and Imogen together  in happy marriage.</p>
