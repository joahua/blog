So I&#8217;d accidentally replaced-from-HEAD a project in CVS here, having not worked on it for a week or two and having forgotten I *had*, in fact, made changes. Oops.

Fortunately, Opera will save your tabs of everything forever in a tab-cache (as well as a file-cache, but rendered), so as soon as I fired that up I knew I was saved! Such a liberating feeling. I love Opera. \*saves images, markup + CSS and hurriedly checks in\*
