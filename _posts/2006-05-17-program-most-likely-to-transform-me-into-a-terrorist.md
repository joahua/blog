So I&#8217;m back to building stylesheets. Feels good. Gets the blood pumping.

Makes me want to strap a bomb to my body and go into Microsoft&#8217;s offices ;-)

IE is fun, but PNG support is seriously painful sometimes. Do anything slightly adventurous and it all blows up in your face (no pun intended). I&#8217;ve decided IE needs a mascot like Firefox (a cute fox) so that I can get a <del>voodoo doll</del> stuffed toy that can sit in the corner of the office to be pummelled as required.
