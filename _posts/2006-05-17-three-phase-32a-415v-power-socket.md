I was trying to describe to someone what a 3 phase 32A 415V socket looked like (at least in Australia) the other day and discovered nothing of assistance in Google at all.

So here are two photos.

Note the easter-egg in this image. If you go to Sydney and need to *show* someone what one looks like, there are about four on the front lawns.

Feel free to steal these images, etc./link to this page. Deep link images and die a horrible death. I&#8217;ve refrained from doing BadThings to a couple of MySpace users thus far, but if anyone with slightly more brains tries it then the images will probably turn into things you&#8217;d rather they didn&#8217;t. Here ends the warning that also applies to every image published here.
