Flickr&#8217;s new Organizr is a huge step backwards. It takes an incredibly usable Flash application, reworks it into a much-slower JavaScript version (that&#8217;s still just as inaccessible, and who really cares about screen readers seeing as we&#8217;re dealing with vast numbers of photos? \*flamebait\*), and in the process removes useful graphic (as in, having the quality of graphs, not graphical) elements, replacing them with numeric date selectors, etc.

Oh, yeah, and they&#8217;re browser-sniffing and rejecting anyone aside from Firefox, Safari, and IE. Which is ridiculous because Opera is so much easier to get to work with stuff than Safari is&#8230; in fact, it&#8217;s one of the better behaved browsers. Meanwhile, Flash would work on anything and so many people have Flash it&#8217;s hardly a great problem. To choose between a great, usable app and a less-usable, quasi-standards-embracing, still-just-as-inaccessible app seems like it should have an obvious outcome. Sigh. Why couldn&#8217;t they just focus on making the Flash thing work better? Multi-select dragging in the Flash UI was the last thing I really desired from Organizr: beyond that, I&#8217;d be pretty much content with existing features. But no&#8230; they had to go tear it apart. Grrr. Just because programmers like numbers, doesn&#8217;t mean the rest of us do. Bring back the drag-and-drop!

p.s. Yes, I know you can get to [the old version still][1]. It&#8217;s not that so much as the new version seems like a massive regression with absolutely zero advantages, and development on the Flash version is going to be in permanent hiatus (at least until they realise I am infallible and surrender in their folly, etc., etc.)
