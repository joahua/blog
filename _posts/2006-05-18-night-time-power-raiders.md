As per [the last post highlighting the location of 3-phase power][1], tonight occasioned a trip (er, perhaps &#8220;drive&#8221; would be more appropriate when speaking of power) to Sydney Uni, to test [a dimmer][2] under the cover of darkness. All is good! And, so far as covert theft-of-wattage goes, it was a great deal of fun ;-) No photos of the occasion, unfortunately.

Everything went well until we tried to unplug the 3-phase from the socket, and the stupid thing ripped out of the sandstone. It wasn&#8217;t properly mounted to start with, but there was still a bit of an &#8220;oh crap&#8221; moment. Especially seeing as the thing was LOCKED in &#8220;On&#8221; position&#8230; yeah, probably not the safest of operations, but everything worked and it&#8217;s not like we needed to rely on it staying in place for a show or anything (obviously didn&#8217;t bother screwing it into place). Yay for ridiculous amounts of lighting powah.
