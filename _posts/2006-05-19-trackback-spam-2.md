What the hell are they thinking? 450 messages since I switched off at about 12.30 last night until 8 when I checked again this morning. I actually bothered to weed through them all and check there weren&#8217;t any legit ones in there. When will you guys realise YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO GET YOUR SPAM TO APPEAR ON THIS BLOG?! The only thing you will *possibly* achieve is the disabling of Trackbacks, which doesn&#8217;t really concern me because Pingbacks are infinitely superior/more secure, etc.

I really hope I never meet any of the people doing this&#8230;
