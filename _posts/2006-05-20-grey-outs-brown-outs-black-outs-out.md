I think my desktop-of-three-years is about to give up on me. The DVD drive appears to have stopped working, and the other day my 40GB volume unexpectedly powered down and the computer soft-reset, with the drive not working until I rebooted properly.

Then my computer apparently turned itself off a day or two later, and I was slightly concerned. Being a well-trained tech-monkey, the first thing I did was check power. I&#8217;d kicked it out&#8230; just.

It was actually still in the power socket, and looking loose enough that it&#8217;d probably been moved out over a period of several days. So it occured to me that maybe it was actually so close I could have nudged it that day my hard-drive failed and caused a brown out&#8230; which isn&#8217;t actually that implausible, if a tad improbable.

Perhaps it&#8217;s not just about to die. Perhaps that&#8217;s what actually happened&#8230; perhaps.

Meanwhile, the computer is still perfectly fast (and would be faster if I gutted and reinstalled Ubuntu) if a little shy on storage space. 40GB is becoming increasingly cramped (even with an additional 10GB drive dedicated to OS + applications), and hard drives are SO CHEAP these days. I&#8217;ll probably save up for a bit to get a 250GB drive and a DVD burner, and a new graphics card whilst I&#8217;m doing the computer shopping thing (there&#8217;s a computer fair at UNSW in two weeks but it was pretty meagre last time I went&#8230;).

The graphics card thing is mostly just so I&#8217;ve got video-out and a DVI connection. I&#8217;m sick of my LCD&#8217;s picture flickering/distorting because of the cheap VGA cable I&#8217;m using! Ah well. Sometime&#8230; I can never be bothered buying computer stuff anymore (unless it&#8217;s on eBay ;-)).
