![Crash][1]

Looked pretty nuts and must have wreaked havoc for city-bound traffic. There&#8217;s a Jeep that was on its side behind that white car&#8230; two ambulances (both empty, fortunately!) and a firetruck, and an unmarked + a marked police car. One of the fireies was taking snaps on his camera phone but I wasn&#8217;t that game, so this is the best I&#8217;ve got. It&#8217;s still a cool photo I think.
