![iPaq with Windows Mobile 2003 running MSN Messenger][1]

I&#8217;ve now joined the tribe of pointless-be-everywhere instant messenging. I only plan on using it when I&#8217;ve got 802.11 coverage, because I&#8217;m so not paying whatever GPRS rates are for it! Still, all good fun for a couple of days. Then I&#8217;ll be asking myself what possessed me to buy such a monstrosity. Ah well.

Addendum: Just checked the cost&#8230; apparently it&#8217;s $0.20c/minute. I&#8217;ve very rarely, if ever, had a conversation on MSN that good. Or at least, not so good that it couldn&#8217;t be supplanted by an even quicker/more effective phonecall.
