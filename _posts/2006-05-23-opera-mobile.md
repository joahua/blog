Opera Mobile is wicked on my new Pocket PC. It&#8217;s actually faster than IE seems to be, and I can use this beta for free until the end of the month!

The main attraction is the way it linearises pages so well. I&#8217;ll seriously consider paying for it once it comes out of beta&#8230;

Oh, and I thought I&#8217;d mention that this post is written in it using a supercool 802.11b link! What with that and quad-band GSM/GPRS and Bluetooth flying around, cancer can&#8217;t be too far off&#8230;
