It&#8217;s been so long since I&#8217;ve actually &#8220;finished&#8221; a stylesheet on a real site (not some tiny two-page thing or an application) that I don&#8217;t remember how to let go. I keep looking around for the little things I&#8217;ve missed (they&#8217;ll always be there), but there&#8217;s increasing amounts of nothing. I&#8217;ve got to say that it&#8217;s fun to do having taken a break (not intentionally, just played out that way because other stuff was going on) for a couple of months&#8230; though I&#8217;m a little more jaded about having to use abs pos and floats everywhere, etc., this time around.

I think it&#8217;s coz I haven&#8217;t done my own designs for quite a while (and am hence contending with table-thought). I need to get my hand in again.

This time it&#8217;ll probably be back to a darker base. Cyclic, I tell you! I was actually thinking of something like [Ellen&#8217;s blog][1] has (only with blue and some colour and less random stuff and without annoying IE-proprietary coloured black-on-black scroll bars!) but was researching some JavaScript stuff today and came across some dark blogs and *wow* did my eyes like that. Probably because between a white design and a white-base code window on two monitors I effectively spent at least 8 hours today staring at panels of light&#8230; but I&#8217;m actually now starting to see the benefits of dark-based high-contrast designs.

I&#8217;m probably just going blind, but statistically that places my preferences closer to those of most of the web, so designers that like tiny type can suck my text-zooming browser. Whilst I make your pretty pixel-perfect designs look horrible as they scale.

I don&#8217;t *want* elastic designs, I want designs that don&#8217;t give a crap what you do to them. That, if you explode them into lots of little pieces, aren&#8217;t overlapping themselves and flow just fine. I kinda feel like I&#8217;m still trying to justify this present design (which, if I haven&#8217;t said this before, actually had its origins as a print stylesheet&#8230; it&#8217;s called &#8220;SC ClearPrint&#8221; for that reason), but if I am I hope to equally be justifying the next. Hoping for something equally functional but slightly prettier.

Whilst talking about styles, handheld styles are actually overrated if you&#8217;ve got a single-column layout. Even if you don&#8217;t, [good handheld/mobile browsers][2] mostly overcome the worst of the web. Semantic markup is actually quite important, having said that, because it reduces code-bloat by so much. When you&#8217;ve got minimal amounts of memory and a relatively slow processor, that kinda stuff matters irrespective of bandwidth.

(Aside: it amuses me to note that, with the exception of disk space, my PDA is more powerful than the first computer we owned &#8212; purchased in 1996(/5?), with a P-133/32MB/4GB/1MB gfx)

Yeah. Sufficiently off-topic to end this here methinks.
