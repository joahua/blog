So far as the album *[Lights and Sounds][1]* goes, this song is pretty different.

> Jimmy wasn&#8217;t really popular  
> He had a couple of friends back home  
> And sooner or later they&#8217;re all getting out so he had to join up alone  
> He was dreaming of the Ivy League since he was only three feet tall  
> And get the hell out of jersey and then he would never look back at all
> 
> And then your heroes say  
> That miles away  
> We lost another one that we sent with a gun  
> They&#8217;re gonna miss him he was two weeks from twenty and there&#8217;s still no shame  
> From the man to blame
> 
> Jimmy never had a reason to stay  
> Cos all the factories shut down  
> All he had was a line for his name  
> So he could sign away his right to be proud  
> He tried to kiss her on the way out the door,  
> She just put her little hand on his face  
> I don&#8217;t understand why you&#8217;re leaving, she said  
> But I hope your gonna ask me to wait
> 
> And then your heroes say  
> That miles away  
> We lost another one that we sent with a gun  
> His lady missed him, he was two weeks from twenty and there&#8217;s still no shame  
> From the man to blame
> 
> Jimmy&#8217;s mother went to Capitol Hill  
> So she could fill her heart up with joy  
> Maybe shake a few hands while she&#8217;s there and tell them thank you sir for taking my boy.
> 
> And then your heroes say  
> That miles away  
> We lost another one that we sent with a gun  
> His momma missed him he was two weeks from twenty and there&#8217;s still no shame  
> From the man to blame  
> No there&#8217;s still no shame  
> And we&#8217;re all to blame  
> We&#8217;re all to blame  
> We&#8217;re all to blame  
> We&#8217;re all to blame  
> We&#8217;re all to blame

Maybe the lyrics of every track are this politicized, and it&#8217;s just that the elocution in this track makes the message more accessible, but I&#8217;d hazard not. I don&#8217;t normally listen to song lyrics, mostly because music is rarely an object-of-attention for me (that is, anything more than appealing noise in the background to aid other tasks), but for some reason this stood out.

I&#8217;ve heard Yellowcard dismissed as emo crap&#8230; is there such thing as political emo crap? I suppose that&#8217;d aptly characterise the apparent inclination of most politically active (i.e. not apathetic/indifferent) uni students: perpetually frustrated and looking to hurt someone (quoth the banner, &#8220;The next cut: Howard&#8217;s neck&#8221;). Well, that seems to be the case at Sydney, anyway. ;-)

Anyway&#8230; enough of that. I liked the song even if it&#8217;s a bit US-parochial (i.e. one guy two weeks from twenty is more valuable than [blank] foreigners) &#8230; and yeah, I know this artistic sentiment isn&#8217;t isolated to recent conflict or even just the US, and yeah, I know it&#8217;s a valid objection. If you haven&#8217;t heard it yet it&#8217;s worth listening to at some point.
