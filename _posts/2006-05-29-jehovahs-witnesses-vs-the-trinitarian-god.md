So I&#8217;d kinda been meaning to get around to looking at what exactly they believed for a couple of months now, because it&#8217;d come up a few times and because it&#8217;s useful to have a clear understanding of what various groups believe (especially those who claim to be of the same faith).

Well, two elderly-ish ladies came knocking this morning (no name tags or suits, even!) and gave me a couple of books, which was pretty timely (but not co-incidental) because Dave made a **brief** comment regarding Christ&#8217;s failure to deny his identity as Lord when Thomas confessed his identity as Lord and God (John 20:24-29), and how this is contrary to what Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses believe. (That &#8212; briefly &#8212; is how I wish Rowan Kemp had dealt with John 1, but no matter. I suppose Gem is the only person who would know what I&#8217;m talking about there&#8230; shrug. He got a feel for the audience better after that week, I think.) The most significant difference between their beliefs and what the Bible teaches is in the realm of God&#8217;s trinitarian nature. That is, they claim Jesus is:

> Jehovah&#8217;s [God's] most precious Son &#8212; and for good reason. He is called &#8220;the firstborn of all creation,&#8221; for he was God&#8217;s first creation. (Colossians 1:15)

I immediately had to check out their quote, because the NIV is what I remembered that verse from (wherein it is rendered &#8220;the firstborn *over* all creation&#8221; &#8212; helpful, but not literal enough for usefulness here). Knowing enough Greek to be dangerous (and probably nowhere near enough to be wise), I wound up checking out the original (after seeing the NASB + ESV agreeing with each other and the JW quote). Firstborn, or [Ï€ÏÏ‰Ï„Î¿Ï„ÏŒÎºÎ¿Ï‚][1] (transliterated *prototokos*), is &#8220;usually [used] as [a] noun, literally or figuratively&#8221;.

So we know that it&#8217;s not necessarily literal, and in other parts of the Bible (Genesis 28:14 amongst others) promises are made that will be carried by the firstborn (the idea of a &#8220;birthright&#8221; persists throughout the whole Bible). In Genesis 25:31, Esau sells his birthright to Jacob&#8230; the idea here is that Jacob becomes the heir. Christ, then, is (as &#8220;firstborn of creation&#8221;), the heir and realiser of all these promises. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean he&#8217;s *literally* God&#8217;s son&#8230; clearly, the idea of firstborn throughout the Bible is tied mostly to that inheritance, not to literal birth (observe again Genesis 25 and Jacob&#8217;s hijacking of his brother&#8217;s inheritance!)

Hence, to say Jesus is the &#8220;firstborn&#8221; over creation is to say that He is the heir of all things (Hebrews 1:1-3a):

> <sup>1</sup>Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, <sup>2</sup>but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. <sup>3</sup>He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power.

I&#8217;m sure someone somewhere has argued all of the above far better, I just can&#8217;t find it and wanted to write this as a way of understanding that more clearly myself. A better argument is probably the Thomas/Jesus thing alluded to above (the talk will be [available online][2] soon, and will be entitled &#8220;What&#8217;s the Conspiracy about Jesus?&#8221;. I found one great article on [the Trinity and Jesus&#8217; status as a deity][3] which is probably worth a read if you wanted to find out more.
