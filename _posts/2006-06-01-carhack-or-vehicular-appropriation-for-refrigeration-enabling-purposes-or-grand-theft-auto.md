Last night Stealthy Selo, Maurading Mark, Getaway Gem and I stole and proceeded to dismantle a car.

2231: Getaway Gem pulls up outside a house in suburban Matraville. There is an anxious wait for all the car&#8217;s occupants; the Insider is not yet Inside, and thus several nervous minutes were spent in contention over who would play Jawbreaker (alas, there was no Bejeweled).

2240: The Insider arrives in an unmarked vehicle. Stealthy Selo moves in to *rendezvous* point, contact is made. The Insider proceeds inside: but there is a complication! The keys have been obscured, so a further accomplice is required on the Inside. The accomplice succeeds in returning with a key &#8212; but it is the wrong one! With much trepidation, he returns inside on a second reconnaissance task, this time emerging with the correct keys. The car in question had already been entered, but hot-wiring cars remains marginally beyond even our elite covert-ops abilities.

2252: Stealthy Selo climbs into the car, which is situated on a slight incline. Without starting the engine, we release the handbrake and roll/push the car some thirty meters from the house. Getaway Gem waits further up the street: she clicks on her lights, and starts her car as Stealthy Selo climbs into front passenger seat, Marauding Mark the back, and I the driver&#8217;s. The Appropriated Vehicle starts first time (!!) and I pull out with Gem following.

2303: The convoy arrives at HQ, whereupon cars are parked, shuffled, and re-arranged so as to enable sufficient access to the Appropriated Vehicle.

2330: The Appropriated Vehicle is emptied ([no meagre task][1]), and [various][2] [cleaning][3] commences. Simultaneously, the [destruction][4] [begins][5].

In this process, a few [strange things][6] are discovered: not to be deterred, we continued in our quest to install a fridge. We needed [power][7] in the boot of the car&#8230; and, short of removing the entire dash, the best we could do was stealing it from the cigarette lighter socket. If we had more time, I would have tapped the back of the lighter socket&#8217;s power and re-crimped the terminals before replacing it, but we didn&#8217;t (have time). A small casualty for a completely-useless-but-rather-cool addition to the boot of any car!

We were finished by about 2:20 am this morning, and un-appropriated the vehicle in due fashion before making an escape in the Odyssey, which had been deposited there earlier that evening in a cunning manouver orchestrated by Getaway Gem&#8217;s stealthy sedan (I really can&#8217;t remember if it&#8217;s a sedan or not, but cheesy alliterative effects are too good to be passed up! Read it and CRINGE! Muwahahaha. And it *was* stealthy. Appropriately missing an interior light, her car could have snuck up on anyone!). All was done by 2:40&#8230; some eight-and-a-half hours later our covert adventures were uncovered.

Happy birthday, Tim!
