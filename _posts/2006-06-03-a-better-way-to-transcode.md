VLC is the world&#8217;s most awesome transcoding tool, just for the record, but I can&#8217;t but help think there have got to be easier ways to transcode. Things like saved presets/preferences would just make the whole process so much faster. And seeing as there are so many options there already, would it be that hard to add in/out point options to the dialog? That way I could transcode without having to then edit + re-encode. Grr.

And I still can&#8217;t afford to build an editing PC so I&#8217;m stuck with my open-source craziness for a while yet. Progress is being made on a non-PC hardware front, but that doesn&#8217;t really help the editing side of things&#8230; which, of late, I seem to be spending more time on without really having a clue what I&#8217;m doing. Best way to learn&#8230;
