There&#8217;s something wonderful about a platform where everything seems moronically simple and there are no codecs to worry about, files that can&#8217;t be read, and processes that might-just-not-complete and eat your entire day. This isn&#8217;t more rampant consumerism&#8230; I&#8217;d trade in a rather-well-specced XP MCE box for a decent Mac soooo quickly right now. \*launches something heavy at computers which will cause failure of exams\*
