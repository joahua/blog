Everything transcoded okay, [Cinelerra][1] even opened the file, I assumed OSS just couldn&#8217;t get a lock on the device because of another sound server, so I edited blind from timings in other playback. It even rendered fine. (Not, of course, in a format everything could read).

Then I realised that there was, in fact, no sound in (what must be) the three-millionth transcoded file and so it defeated me, at last. I was *so* excited for five minutes there that I&#8217;d be able to quickly do things the way I was planning on doing them from the start, but it wasn&#8217;t to be. So now someone will have to cue a file manually for playback&#8230; but at least it won&#8217;t be off a DVD that&#8217;ll inevitably take an embarrasingly-long period of time to spin-up.

Time to re-read Philippians 2:14-17 and shut up, I think.

> <sup>14</sup>Do everything without complaining or arguing, <sup>15</sup>so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe <sup>16</sup>as you hold out the word of lifeâ€”in order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor for nothing. <sup>17</sup>But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.

Praying for patience, energy.
