![Bejeweled][1]

Consider it under trial. I downloaded it not-from-an-official source because I haven&#8217;t got a Windows machine hooked up to this thing and can&#8217;t install anything by ActiveSync, so I needed an unofficial package (that, in this case, just happened to be cracked because that file looked like the right approx size on various peer-to-peer nets). If I&#8217;m not over it after 30 days I&#8217;ll fork out $15 or whatever it is from AstraWare. Which I probably won&#8217;t be (nor, I imagine, will various [other users][2] of this thing allow me to!)
