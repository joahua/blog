Only it&#8217;s tea weather so much that &#8220;tea&#8221; has suddenly become &#8220;te&#8221;, as my burnt tongue struggles with the motion of &#8220;eay&#8221; (te-eay). Would you like some te?

Tea and soup weather, that is. Not coffee because of awful instant and its amazingly bland contextual associations (has anyone ever drunk instant coffee anywhere interesting?), and the fact that real coffee is too far away/too expensive/with too many side effects I really don&#8217;t need, being awake and up/down plenty already. Anyway, tea is warmer. Coffee you spend your time waiting for it to cool because burning your tongue with coffee is infinitely worse, as the taste imprints itself and won&#8217;t go away until you burn your tongue with something else, and then, assuming you didn&#8217;t burn your mouth, end up drinking it luke-warm (yuck) as quickly as possible because most hot drinks don&#8217;t taste any good luke-warm, least of all one that (when badly made from instant) probably didn&#8217;t taste that great to start with. Sigh. So many people over-rate coffee (that sentence is meant to be like that, because coffee can be good but mostly isn&#8217;t and this fact is ignored by the masses, etc.).
