But I thought I&#8217;d mention my first end-of-semester exam just happens to fall on 6/6/06. At 16:00. Co-incidence? I think not! Heh. Let *The Omen* try and monopolise dates all it wants&#8230; even university faculties have a strange sense of symbolic appropriateness in scheduling events. (Just for the record I don&#8217;t place much importance on the date. Just another day. It seems especially bizarre once you expand the date fully&#8230; 6/6/2006&#8230; what&#8217;s the &#8220;2000&#8243; got to do with anything?)

Whilst criticizing the movie, it&#8217;s worth remarking that the only trailer I&#8217;ve seen for it was the most phenomenally underwhelming film trailer I&#8217;ve ever seen. Like, I actually had no response to it. Normally at least I&#8217;d go &#8220;wow that looks like a crap movie&#8221; to a bad trailer&#8230; this didn&#8217;t even evoke that much emotion. The impact of the trailer on me was literally zero. Having said that, being a fan of the genre for whatever reason (trashy, suspensful, potentially cool special effects, whatever) and watching too many films anyway (except for the, err, allegedly formative/canonical works of a medium that certain people have been trying to make me watch forever), I may well end up seeing it. The possibility is significantly lower than if the trailer hadn&#8217;t been utter crap. Even if my response is &#8220;wow that looks like a crap movie&#8221;, I might *feel like* watching a crap/trashy movie and actively choose to see it once in a cinema-context. That&#8217;s happened plenty in the past, with varying consequences in terms of enjoyment of film.

Then again, maybe the film is actually just that boring. A shot of some kid on a swing was the best they&#8217;ve got. It wasn&#8217;t even an understated trailer, because the clichÃ©d VO guy was out in full force if I recall correctly. Nope, must just be a crap movie.
