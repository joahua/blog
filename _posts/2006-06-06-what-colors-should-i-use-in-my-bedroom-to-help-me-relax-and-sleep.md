The question is stolen from [this Ask Yahoo! post][1], which gives a phenomenally long (and moronic) post.

My recipe for sleep: What colo*u*rs should you use in your bedroom to help you relax and sleep? None, duh. Lights off, dark, eyes shut. Yahoo! are way off.

Of course, the best way to get an answer would be to [go ask an expert][2]. Everyone knows Yahoo!&#8217;s Ask team are insomniac geeks ;-)
