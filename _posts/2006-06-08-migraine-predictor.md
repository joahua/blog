Bejeweled is cool and all, but it&#8217;s become compulsive already. Just to contextualise this a bit, Aaron half-seriously asked if I were autistic a few weeks back after I asked if a TV displaying/playing nothing (black screen) could be turned off because of the noise the tube made. Also, I get pretty bad migraines sometimes (there&#8217;s one coming now, but I want to blog this before I forget and twenty minutes will hardly make a difference).

When I&#8217;m in significant pain (be that massive headaches/migraines w/ various assoc. symptoms, or general other illness&#8230; vomiting etc., or specific physical pain) my first motive to &#8220;alleviate&#8221; it is simply distraction. I&#8217;ll start by hopping between thoughts as rapidly as possible because every thought I land on *somehow* I manage to link back to the problem at hand (i.e. pain), and I can only avoid coming back to that by randomly jumping between thoughts before following them to their &#8220;logical&#8221; (read: present circumstantial) conclusion. This is, inevitably, pretty useless&#8230; and when I finally give up on finding disconnected thoughts I settle for patterns. If it&#8217;s not a headache (i.e. I don&#8217;t mind my eyes being open) I&#8217;ll trace lines on whatever surfaces I can see, or, if I can&#8217;t see (/don&#8217;t want to open eyes), I&#8217;ll invent patterns/logical problems. Which I can never remember afterwards but am aware occurred. And proceed to solve compulsively until the pain disappears (generally where replaced with sleep).

The thing is, these are usually strategies I semi-consciously employ after recognising pain. Today it was different.

I would close my eyes at work, trying to focus on an aspect of a rather gnarly CSS situation (web-geek stuff, to demystify/ungeek this post) , and suddenly the various symbols in the game would be re-arranging themselves (or, I would be controlling them but without even thinking of the game) in my [perceived field-of-view? is there a word for imagined vision once you close your eyes? I take it that's normal... it's not imagination and it's not synesthesia, so... I *think* that it's normal]. Normally I can feel headaches coming, but sometimes I&#8217;ll just have a really dull one from staring at a screen for too long&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t particularly bug me and, if anything, I was pretty good with screen-time-focus today. Anyway, I leave work and go to bible study at Ant and Sarah&#8217;s flat, and am completely fine (if remarkably full of food following dinner and Ant&#8217;s, err, &#8220;21st&#8221; cake) until we&#8217;re praying&#8230; at which point I shut my eyes again and am completely unable to concentrate on what&#8217;s going on around me. I&#8217;m more aware of a headache when I open my eyes again, but it&#8217;s not significant.

Later, Gem is driving back home (for which I&#8217;m so thankful, because, as will become clear, I really shouldn&#8217;t have been driving) and I shut my eyes for a moment &#8212; you know that moment, as a passenger at night where you can just lean your head back and enjoy darkness, momentary rest? Then, by the time I open them again (two seconds later, max), everything is that much worse. I really want to go back to puzzles in my head to distract from (now apparently oncoming) migraine.

This is all really strange. These things aren&#8217;t meant to happen on their own, its some weird reflex that&#8217;s meant to happen when you&#8217;re allowed to shut your eyes and clench your teeth to respond to headaches, not before&#8230; time to crash. Speaking of which, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do now. \*rearranges puzzles/sleeps\*
