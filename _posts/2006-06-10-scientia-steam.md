<p>Rain turns into steam instantly as it hits architectural lighting at UNSW&#8217;s Scientia building. This looked cool and entertained me for about five minutes before I decided it [the rain] wasn&#8217;t going away and proceeded to run, jump, and strafe my way between covered areas to the top of the campus, followed by a light sprint (fuzzy alcohol feeling plus shoes that didn&#8217;t take kindly to rain made it lighter than it may have been!) home. The camera survived.</p>
