I am so sick of [Red Hot Chili Peppers&#8217; *Stadium Arcadium*][1] (album). Not because I&#8217;ve been listening to radio.

More often than not I delegate music selection to others in this part of the world. I&#8217;ve setup two 1RU mixers which go into a Yamaha amplifier/receiver that provides music in the office here, and generally speaking I&#8217;m quite content for someone else to sit and battle with &#8220;what comes next&#8221;. Sometimes it&#8217;s fun to play DJ, but, mostly, if there&#8217;s someone else willing to do it I&#8217;ll defer all power/abdicate all responsibility.

Unfortunately, this creates a radio-esque situation at times&#8230; as with this album. It might be absolutely massive, weighing in at 28 tracks (14 per CD), but it still all manages to sound like RHCP. Not that that should be a bad thing&#8230; I quite like their music. Just not in the kinds of doses we&#8217;ve had around here of late. Sigh.

I&#8217;m at the point where I could really go some electronica (yeah, including RnB) of some description&#8230; anything but rock with occasional acoustic tendencies. Staind would be an option, because they&#8217;re so heavily processed it&#8217;s great. Sure, all their music sounds the same, but it&#8217;s good fun. In a middle-aged-rocker angsty-kinda way. You know it&#8217;s not your normal late-twenties group when they&#8217;re singing about their kids. Well, okay, that&#8217;s not the focus of most of their music, but still. They&#8217;re old!

And I have no idea what that has to do with overplay. Whatever, music needs to change. I&#8217;m going out now and braving radio in the car. Should be great fun.
