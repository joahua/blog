Awesome night spent at Dave Roger&#8217;s house watching football (with the aide of Windows MCE, HDTV (4:3 Pan-and-Scan because I was fooled by the pre-match coverage into thinking they weren&#8217;t bothering to send 16:9 back!! Lesson learnt after the match finished and I played with it a bit, it&#8217;ll be widescreen next time) . [More coverage on Flickr][9]!
