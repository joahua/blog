Just to say that we can. Destroying ourselves just to say that we can.

Affluence informing choices of practical indifference.

Cognition questioning its role in an indifferent and apathetic society: post-reason. Post-everything, bar one. And that is more than some (post-)structuralist theory.

For now? I&#8217;m sick of it. Over it. I&#8217;d love to argue my way out of this hole but that presumes an audience (there is one) who will bother engaging with arguments (therein lies the problem). So, I smugly reassure myself of my own correctness (though smugness isn&#8217;t as fun when no-one else gives a crap), and try and remember that all we&#8217;re doing is producing worthless material no-one will ever engage with/be enriched by/informed by/care about.

It&#8217;s not that the art is a false economy *per se* (though it may be), but simply that what we are producing is not, by any stretch of the imagination, of value. Hence, it is not art.

We practice our artless art-form in full view of the world, as though a patron may be enticed by its austerity. The patron, obviously, is a masochist. Our art-form is *dada*, we produce meaningless *noise*. We automate the production of meaningless noise. It is more than noise. It is noise filled with blades; more than [passively] ambient, tantamount to harm, destructive of society.

But that is, of course, what society desired all along. Just to prove that it could&#8230; what?
