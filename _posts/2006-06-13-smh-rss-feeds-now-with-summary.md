It&#8217;s difficult to state how happy this makes me. No more will some &#8220;creative&#8221; subeditor&#8217;s headline force me to click an article to figure out what on earth it&#8217;s actually about! <http://feeds.smh.com.au/rssheadlines/top.rss> gives the latest, worth sticking into your reader if you do the syndication thing.
