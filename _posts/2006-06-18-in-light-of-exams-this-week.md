I&#8217;ve decided it was finally time to upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu. This is \*usually\* both easier and quicker than most Windows upgrades, but the potential for insatiable time-wasting is certainly there. I&#8217;m mostly engaging in this monumental act of stupidity because (I claim) it is too late to study (but never too late to engage in IT-related stupidity&#8230; unfortunately not alcohol-directed &#8212; read on) and because I&#8217;m driving to Dave Rodger&#8217;s house in an hour and a half or so &#8212; that is how long it should take me to install this thing and get everything back to normal &#8212; to watch Australia play Brazil&#8230; and probably lose along the way. Certainly not what I&#8217;m hoping for, but&#8230; actually, who am I kidding? If we get knocked out of the World Cup there&#8217;ll be no excuses to stay up to stupid times of the morning anymore in weeks leading into exams. Hmm&#8230; but if we play again it&#8217;ll probably be after my exams are over. Dilemma. Bah! Aussie Aussie Aussie!

So&#8230; yes. Here ends the blog post. I&#8217;m off to break my computer.
