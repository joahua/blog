From an [article in the Sydney Morning Herald regarding John Marsden&#8217;s will][1] comes this:

> And if fellow parishioners at St John&#8217;s Catholic Church in Campbelltown thought they had heard the last of Mr Marsden they were mistaken, given the money he left for special Masses.
> 
> Cardinal George Pell, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, said yesterday that some priests charged nominal fees of $5, $10 or $20 to say prayers for the repose of the soul, while others charged nothing.
> 
> Asked yesterday about the $20,000 Mr Marsden had left for this purpose, Dr Pell described it as &#8220;a good investment&#8221;.

Uhmm, okay. We (Protestants/Catholics) really, *really* are not on the same page. Or the same book. If Cardinal Pell&#8217;s comment is indicative of any kind of official position &#8212; and one would hope that it is, for, quite clearly, Protestantism&#8217;s failure is that it rejects a central heirarchical (human) authority &#8212; we&#8217;re probably not even in the same library.

I thought they left all that indulgences/purgatory stuff alone a little while after Luther? Apparently not.
