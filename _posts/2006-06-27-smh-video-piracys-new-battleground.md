In an article entitled &#8220;[Video Piracy&#8217;s New Battleground][1]&#8220;, addressing the rise of an Australian copyrighted-material indexing service (much like, I gather, The Pirate Bay but for linear web content, not P2P nets), comes this delightful passage:

> The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), which was instrumental in launching legal action against file-sharing network Kazaa in recent years, declined to comment this week on any specific threats presented by video portals.
> 
> However, chief executive Stephen Peach did say: &#8220;We are always concerned where it is the case where people build businesses around other people&#8217;s copyrighted music.&#8221;

At this point we must all nod our heads sagely: there is indeed something wrong with the recording industry&#8217;s business model &#8212; at last, they admit it.

p.s. First person to make a wise crack about how artists don&#8217;t actually own their own copyright a lot of the time gets a punch in the face :-)
