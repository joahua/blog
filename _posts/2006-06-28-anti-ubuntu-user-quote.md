I stumbled across this on the web today sometime.

> Ubuntu is an African word meaning &#8220;I can&#8217;t configure Debian&#8221;.

It&#8217;s funny coz its true :) I got a new (new for me, it&#8217;s a Geforce 3 that has VIVO ports) graphics card today and am having a not-fun time trying to get TV-out working for tomorrow evening (!). Ah well. Mostly just coz I&#8217;m rather seriously capped right now, having done about 18GB last time I checked (it didn&#8217;t start shaping until probably 18.5 or 19GB, so definitely happy this month!)

It must be coz I had exams and was home more, or something.
