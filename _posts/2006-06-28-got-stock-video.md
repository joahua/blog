If you&#8217;ve got stock video (random karaoke crap useless for anything else but mixed ambient visuals &#8212; OR &#8212; people footage from videoclips that are missing plots. Which basically means rap videos I&#8217;d say.) and wouldn&#8217;t mind lending me the CDs/DVDs for a day (preferably in Quicktime/MOV format, compressed as little as possible, no crazy codec variants) AND would be free for me to grab them tomorrow afternoon, send me an SMS/get in touch leaving a comment/whatever.

I can have plenty of fun with realtime vis from video inputs, but depending on how much light there is in the room it&#8217;d be nice to have stock to fall back on.

The occasion is nothing too serious&#8230; it&#8217;s an end-of-studycamp party for a Crusaders camp, so my ambitions are entirely my own and hardly out of any great need to impress&#8230; toy lights do a good enough job of that without video&#8217;s help. Just pushing myself a bit for kicks. I picked up a vision mixer a few weeks back for cheap that doesn&#8217;t have inbuilt TBC but can fade one source and has a positioner on black (well, positioner on another layer if you&#8217;ve got genlocked sources) which will hopefully perform okay. Despite it not having TBC it *will* say when sources are in sync, which is kinda nifty. I&#8217;ll eventually invest in a decent vision mixer but at the minute they&#8217;re still a little out of my range. If it&#8217;s not a horrendous failure, I&#8217;ll report how it works out :-)

Lighting will be lame party gear that I&#8217;ll hopefully mount significantly off the ground (there are four places in the room I can use) at least in part and then probably have one or two larger fixtures in corners/on a T-stand. Lighting, as always, will be largely forgiven by copious quantities of fog. Projection *should* improve matters in the room somewhat (in terms of visual quality) BUT will probably be rendered ineffective by the fog. If it&#8217;s too bad then I&#8217;ll just switch to visualisations, which is totally not a big deal at all&#8230; I just don&#8217;t get to be quite as creative \*dreams of a plasma in every corner instead of a sole projector\*.

So yeah, I am mildly excited. Will be staying up there overnight unless I&#8217;m feeling particularly energetic and in a driving-mood late that evening&#8230; the camp is at Galston which is slightly north of Hornsby. Doesn&#8217;t have to be a particularly long drive, and it&#8217;d undoubtedly be less susceptible to peak-hour traffic if I went back that night instead of Friday morning, but still&#8230; it&#8217;d be late. We&#8217;ll see.
