Spent re-wiring Tim&#8217;s car after sound install people broke + stole end of fridge power lead, trying to get a clearer idea of what&#8217;s happening logistically next week (less complicated than I thought it&#8217;d be), discovering we&#8217;ve parked Tim&#8217;s car in the garage and can&#8217;t get it out because of a car we don&#8217;t have keys to, eating pizza in an ice-cream shop, stumbling upon (well, we knew them) a buck&#8217;s night involving a cross-dressing violin-busker and an unfortunate encounter with one member of the party&#8217;s ex-students, a fight with cleaning implements in aforementioned ice-cream shop, culminating in the discovery that, in fact, there is very little to be gained by turning off the lights and running in such a situation due to the copious light pollution afforded by display lights from fridges, etc.

Well fine it wasn&#8217;t that crazy, but&#8230; sufficiently exciting. Tomorrow I&#8217;m waking up at 6.30 (!!) to go get a projector for next week away (!!!). That said, this could well be the last post before leaving&#8230; but that&#8217;s probably rather unlikely. Now gonna go catch a quite-reasonable six and a half hours of sleep.
