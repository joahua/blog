<img src="/blog/wp-content/2006/07/flickr-photoset-view.png" alt="A screenshot of view discussed" style="float:right;" /> Flickr&#8217;s photoset view irritates me. There&#8217;s always *so much* whitespace it&#8217;s not funny, the columns are divided but the &#8220;cells&#8221; (apparently, for they&#8217;re not in a table I don&#8217;t think &#8212; can&#8217;t be bothered checking) are stacked without space, and the page goes on forever resultingly. The screenshot with this post (right) isn&#8217;t even the entire page. That&#8217;s about two thirds of the content right there. I cut the image for visual brevity, etc.

Point is, they should be doing this lots better but aren&#8217;t. All it&#8217;d take is a floated div or two, and it&#8217;s not like their website isn&#8217;t complex enough with JS/CSS/whatever already&#8230; the current design is utterly illogical and can only be justified as an effort (made consciously) to make people make shorter photo sets (financial/bandwidth incentive, perhaps?). Pfft. I didn&#8217;t pay my (however much per year) to <del>Flickr, Inc.</del> Yahoo!&#8217;s acquisitions team (it passes for innovation, perhaps? ;-) Okay I&#8217;ve had my little jab now.) to put up measly numbers of photos. You give me 2GB/month uploads and at the minute I&#8217;m using up to nearly half of that &#8212; and, yeah, it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ll pay for, because 90% of the time it&#8217;s mind-numbingly easy and painless. 10% is little UI stupidity issues such as this one. Sigh.
