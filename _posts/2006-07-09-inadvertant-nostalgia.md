I was doing really well trying not to think about any time other than *now*/future, until someone asked for something (past) to be changed. Which of course meant observing other things from the past, which of course meant remembering everything associated with those times. It&#8217;s just a slip in sentiment, that&#8217;s all. Don&#8217;t over-analyse the word &#8216;nostalgia&#8217;, its etymologies, popular culture allusions (in an inverse aetiological sense, meaning I thought of it first and then discovered similar foundations elsewhere), and all possible meanings (I can think of only two) in its usage. Anyway, it was entirely accidental. It&#8217;s not as though I stood there throwing taunts at some maddened, blind cyclops, revealing identities boastfully as the impious brute runs crying to its father. No: convenient mythological explanations for any of this are decidedly thin on the ground.
