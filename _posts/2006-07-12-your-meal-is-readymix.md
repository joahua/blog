Porridge this morning. I&#8217;m not usually a porridge person but it looked warming. I went to microwave it and laughed when the finished message displayed on it&#8217;s screen (&#8220;Meal is ready&#8221;) as I had extrapolated &#8220;ready&#8221; before it scrolled across the screen to be &#8220;Readymix&#8221; (that is, a [cement company][1] in Australia and various other countries). It was surprisingly nice for the thick brown-grey coloured substance that it is.
