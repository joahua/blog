It just occurred to me that the most frustrating thing about time-travel for anyone post-Intellectual-Property law would be the discovery of various things they themselves had previously identified as &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t-it-be-great-if&#8221; concepts. Case in point, Caller-ID: &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if you could tell who was calling before answering?&#8221; Yes, it is. Everyone with a mobile (pretty much) has this. Imagine if you&#8217;d thought of it a little more seriously when you lived just a short while after Bell/Meucci/Reis invented/stole/plagiarised the telephone.
