![Cat creeping out of a drain][1]

The cat/rat distinction is somewhat blurry. I was coming out of the driveway earlier this week and was perplexed to see what I thought to be the face of a cat staring at me from inside a drain. By the time I stopped the car, got out my camera, turned it on, and snapped, the cat was a little further out. 

Yes, I go home and practice my ninja-speed-photo-taking abilities at night. \*ahem\*
