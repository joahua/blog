![Lense flare at night from a bright moon][1] ![Moon above a carpark][2]

The first image would have been a spectacular photo with the aid of a tripod, a bigger camera, and more time. I was running late going somewhere one night and took this as I headed off. The industral setting of it all is epitomised by the moon itself appearing harshly bright, like some unforgiving floodlight for night-work. Only vastly more brilliant, and, in (probably) any other context, beautiful.

The second image is chiefly provided for the clarity that the first lacks.
