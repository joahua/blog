OH MY GOODNESS I PASSED WITH CREDIT!!!

It strikes me that the marks must have been horribly scaled, much of the rest of the cohort have intellects that could be best applied removing gum from carpets, or I am, in fact, a borderline genius and simply chose not to take advantage of this until in the exam room (which, it is worth noting, I turned two minutes late for, had a nose-bleed in, and left early having exhausted my knowledge of the subject some time previously). Or, alternative, the subject is a wank and it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered what I wrote.

Sure, 71 isn&#8217;t anything special, but I fail to see how I attained a mark that high! W00t.
