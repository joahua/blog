Well the girls were having some ridiculously girly movie night (a *[Suddenly 30][1]* sleepover &#8212; aka *13 going on 30* in most other regions, for some reason the Australian release got a different name), so we decided to go one better.

![Spoof poster: Suddenly Arnie, Arnold Schwarzennegger vs. Suddenly 30/13 going on 30/Jennifer Garner.][2]

Only ended up watching two movies but both were absolute quality&#8230; the first ([*Army of Darkness*][3]) because of mediocre (but not outright bad, and not pretentious at all) production values/ridiculous/fun plot, and the second ([*Commando*][4]) because of Arnie and associated explosions, gratuitous violence, barely-remembered-one-liners (it was noted his name is always John, presumably because, being monosyllabic, he will at least remember to answer to it), etc. Good times had by all.
