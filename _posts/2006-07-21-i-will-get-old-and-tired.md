For now, I will revel in youthful energy and apply that as keenly as I will; my reminiscences will be accentuated by such things, perhaps, but it is such a short while and there is always the possibility I will not remember that anyway, not realise what has been lost. And even so, it will not matter, for my tiredness will be a fortuitous declaration of what had gone before. Now, you see, the challenge is to *earn* that tiredness [of decay alone, not what follows death] such that the pattern may be established, strengthened, and developed keenly to some none-too-distant point whereupon rest will be forthcoming (though even there, &#8216;rest&#8217; shall not denote an absence of activity!)

So much will fade before we are bright again; but we may still burn inwardly. Let not the light be hidden.
