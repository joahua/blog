Ouch. All my subjects require readers and this semester comes to a grand total of $106.25 (25 cents they charged on top for my using a credit card&#8211;the reader pricing itself isn&#8217;t that erratic). I thought I&#8217;d escaped lightly this semester until I bothered checking the UCC website, which kindly informed me all my subjects had readers. And I plan to actually read them. Shock, horror.

Has anyone else noticed this blog has suddenly become all about uni?
