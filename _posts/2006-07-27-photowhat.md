Oh dear. I&#8217;ve finally succumbed to the allure of Photoshop. In one moment just then it all clicked and suddenly the GIMP is vastly inferior. Now I&#8217;m going to find myself trying GIMPshop or something ridiculous. Not that it&#8217;s ridiculous at all, because the GIMP remains an infinitely faster and ligher-weight program that performs admirably&#8230; it&#8217;s just not as feature rich.

Please note, above statements should not be taken as constituting a revelation of sudden visual-creativity to the point of designer prodigy: my creativity remains as it always has been (take that as you will; I still think my crowning design achievement would have been the now-passed SC500 theme for this site, sad though that may be).

The straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back? Nothing complex or difficult or even unusual. It&#8217;s just layer/selection scaling in the GIMP is excruciating when juxtaposed against it&#8217;s $900 rival. Sigh. So I might end up purchasing CS2 plus Macromedia stuff under an academic license sometime in the future.
