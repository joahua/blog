Everything on my bookshelf is left-leaning. I will prop them against the left side of the shelf with no difficulty incurred, but to right-align them is a recipe for revolution and/or spectacular suicide attempts &#8212; better dead than re[a]d takes on a whole new meaning. I have a feeling this is something to do with our reading from left-to-right, top-to-bottom way of doing things. Which, amusingly, would make the literature of some communist nations right-leaning.

Oh the irony.

Oh the procrastination, that I will sit here blogging about the politics of my bookshelf. Sigh (good sigh :))
