[MySpace][1] really know how to spend money. They&#8217;re presently repositioning htemselves as &#8216;a place for music&#8217; (distinct, more astute readers shall note, from its previous slogan: &#8216;a place characterised by bizarre and angsty teenage social interaction or lack thereof&#8217; &#8212; not quite as catchy) to the point that they are now sponsoring tours such that they are even being co-billed with [Frontier][2] on a poster I just encountered (I&#8217;m on a bus) for a Dashboard Confessional gig at the Horden next month.

How on earth they&#8217;re ever going to transform endless promotion into financial return is beyond me&#8230; but hey, I hear they&#8217;ve bought an Xbox hot air balloon, so at least they&#8217;re in good money-losing company. (Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox division, for those not in the loop, is more commonly known as the 4-billion-and-increasing-dollar-hole.)
