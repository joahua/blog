My room hasn&#8217;t smelt like overheating light for too long. It&#8217;s the smell of reading well past bedtime, neither of which particularly exists anymore. I&#8217;ve probably made other plans by the time this is read, anyway. Allusions are dry things, and metaphors draining&#8230; so I&#8217;ll pass this time. Simple.
