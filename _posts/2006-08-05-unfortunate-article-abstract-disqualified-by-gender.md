From this evening&#8217;s SMH website comes this abstract/second-level headline &#8220;Floyd Landis likely to lose Tour de France title and has been sacked from his team, after testing positive for testosterone.&#8221;

Yes, he is male, yes, it was a male contest. This is why arbitarily dropping adjectives to achieve headline-friendly &#8216;sentences&#8217; is a bad idea. It originally read &#8220;excessive testosterone&#8221;, but now appears that all the other cyclists were, erm, somewhat lacking.
