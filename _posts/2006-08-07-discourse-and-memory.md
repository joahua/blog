Stories, in the retelling, become consecrated to that circumstance. Insofar as that circumstance is allowed to persist (&#8216;circumstance&#8217; itself being a broadly-defined concept of context), the story (intimacy excepted) may be retold to others. But it is not anything about the story itself. The most benign of ideas may, in discourse, become of great significance &#8212; this significance stems not from the retelling; rather, the *process* of retelling is used to attach personal meaning that the mediocre might become magnificent.

A row of absurdly painted faces turn.

This has two links: of the context of discourse, and of the geography of events related. I do not relate the events here, but after writing this perhaps I may [wish to]. Words evoke memories, basically. The fascinating thing is not just that, but rather the ability of words evoking memories to evoke memories (that is, the words, not the memories, were the catalyst for other memories). Way to go taking a simple concept and making it complex!

The point is, the mind is awesome yet simultaneously twisted&#8230;
