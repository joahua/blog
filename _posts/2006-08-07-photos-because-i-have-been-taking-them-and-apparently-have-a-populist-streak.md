Can anyone guess where this is?

Could be a social comment on the nature of emoticon-based expression, perhaps? Imprisoning, unmoving, cold&#8230; how odd! Who would think such things? :p

![Demolition of a building in Sydney with one wall remaining][3]

There is a massive building being demolished in the city at the minute. The fact they&#8217;ve left one incredibly thin wall (left of frame) standing is completely absurd, but I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some sophisticated engineering decision behind it. It barely looks strong enough to withstand a decent kick were one to somehow reach high enough, being (apparently) a layer of bricks thick with slightly crumbling mortar and a flimsy wooden internal support system that&#8217;s probably well and truely rotten by now.
