I actually had the worst dream I&#8217;ve had in a long time last night. For whatever reason, it was suddenly decided that I was going to start attending [UoW][1] (not a bad thing in itself!) and, accordingly, move into a college down there (nevermind that I&#8217;d heard at least one of the colleges down there went bankrupt and didn&#8217;t even know how many others there were). I think it was something to do with a decision parentals had made, though I don&#8217;t know exactly what it could have been &#8212; I&#8217;m fairly autonomous, so they&#8217;d hardly be choosing a uni for me, and considering rent cost in Woollongong (1 bedroom flat for between $130-$150 a week) living out of a college would probably be cheaper and more likely what I&#8217;d go for, for various reasons. I remembered thinking it would be okay if I owned a car, but then thinking that I can&#8217;t really afford a car. Then, after that, realising that employment/prospects for employment are inextricably bound up in Sydney for me, knowing no-one in Woollongong (not even on mailing lists!) and not feeling terribly inclined to start working in a &#8216;normal&#8217; uni-student job. Add to that the fact that I&#8217;d have to start working more (again) in order to support cost of living, etc., and the whole situation starts to suck quite a bit in terms of study. The not-having-a-car/uncertainty-about-public-transport thing gets worse when one starts looking for a good church within walking/bike distance.

Anyway I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been so stressed in a dream before. (Stressed is different to scared, note!) I&#8217;m presently trying to figure out exactly why it was dreamt at all. Something to do with relative uni proximity/ease of pretty-much-everything in my present circumstances, perhaps.
