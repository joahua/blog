They don&#8217;t exist. Well, not for under $350. Why is it so hard to come by a decent, normal, boring access point? I don&#8217;t want a router with four ports and a pathetic access point attached, I want a decent 802.11b/g/lmnop access point, preferably with dual antennas but not neccessarily, with a readily available wall-mount kit, and a single bridge ethernet port would be a bonus. Various encryption stuffs are welcome but not required. Max price $150, ideally sub-$100 for something with one antenna and no wall-mount kit (I&#8217;d build one anyway I think), which is reasonable because you can get wireless ADSL routers now for that much. Yes, give me less functionality and convergence and more usefulness/appropriateness to purpose.
