I was doing some research today and came across this [spectacularly bad greenhouse information resource][1] from the Australian Greenhouse Office (part of our Commonwealth&#8217;s Department of the Environment and Heritage). It (mostly sensibly) advocates ways to save energy in the expensive &#8220;install energy-efficient lighting&#8221; bit, but then proceeds to soundly shoot itself in the foot under &#8220;Use lights efficiently&#8221;.

<ins datetime="2006-08-14T12:36:34+00:00"><strong>Update</strong>: I discovered a <a href="http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/yourhome/technical/fs45.htm">resource on the same Greenhouse site that explains things much more accurately/clearly</a>. Or maybe just more geekily. Anyway, I found it helpful. Down the bottom of that page it&#8217;s basically point by point the same just using different words and being generally less stupid. Now all they gotta do is amalgamate resources/rewrite the &#8220;brief&#8221; copy.</ins>

&#8220;Buy and use compact fluoros instead of incandescent lighting&#8221; (sensible) versus &#8220;Modern dimmer controls reduce greenhouse gas emissions as they reduce light output. They also extend lamp life.&#8221; (ridiculous &#8211; and incompatible with CF lighting)

&#8220;Fit lower-wattage globes or compact fluorescents in bright lights, especially downlights and spotlights; save up to 50% of greenhouse gas.&#8221;  
**Potentially ridiculous**: As increasing numbers of downlights/spots are using halogen bulbs, more are being installed to compensate for stupidly narrow beams. This doesn&#8217;t *have* to be the case, but people seem to opt for narrow beam lights for some reason. Replace one 80W@240V (3A) fixture with six 30Â° 50W@12V (1.5A) + transformer power consumption (varies) &#8212; you&#8217;re really not saving much. ALSO, there is no CF alternative to halogens so far as I know. There ARE some LED products on the market, but they&#8217;re probably a garish blue (or at least a fair way from the 3000K temperature we generally expect from domestic lighting) and still cost upwards of $AU25/unit, versus about $5 for a regular halogen. The obvious advantage here is that they don&#8217;t require reflectors and will thus automatically have a wider coverage, along with rubbish total cost of ownership stuff that no-one really cares enough about to pay attention.)

&#8220;Reflector-back lamps of lower wattage provide more useful light in downlights or spotlights while generating less greenhouse gas.&#8221;  
**Potentially ridiculous**: what did I just say? Yes, this is helpful, no, it&#8217;s not the best option. Think of it as reducing the evils of halogens (except for where you need/don&#8217;t mind 270Â°+ vertical light coverage, which is sometimes).

&#8220;Low voltage halogen lamps are not necessarily low energy lamps: each one generates one kilogram of greenhouse gas every 15 hours â€“ about the same as an ordinary 60-watt globe â€“ although they do produce more light.&#8221;  
**Potentially faulty maths** I don&#8217;t know how they arrived at that figure. But then again I&#8217;m an English major so there we go. They must have really pumped the transformer figure, OR they&#8217;re talking about the mythical 240V halogen &#8212; a creature rarely found in the wild, but rumoured to exist. Hardly ever in use.

&#8220;Use light fittings which allow maximum light to pass through â€“ coloured glass often cuts light output by half, creating a need for higher-wattage lamps.&#8221;  
**Good call. Completely irrelevant to domestic settings.** Well, kinda. Unless they&#8217;re expecting people to rip apart their lamp-shades today. Maybe in twenty years when we&#8217;re out of fuel and are struggling to start a fire huddled in a cave&#8230; yeah, right.

&#8220;A 20-watt compact fluorescent provides as much light as a 100-watt incandescent.&#8221;  
**Sure.** Which is all fun and games until you&#8217;ve been conned into purchasing them by above disinformation thinking they&#8217;ll cope okay with your crappy variable pot dimmer. Then, out go the incandescents when Joe Consumer thinks they break too quickly.

&#8220;A 20-watt compact fluorescent provides as much light as a 100-watt incandescent.&#8221;  
**Yup.**

&#8220;Timer controls and daylight or movement sensors are now available to switch off lights automatically.&#8221;  
**They sure can. Great for keeping your house dark, not so great for cutting emissions.** Insert vague statistics about the amount of unnecessary power consumed by devices on standby in the average domestic setting each year. Some small benefit might be realised, but you&#8217;d be better just cultivating a habit of turning off lights when leaving rooms.

&#8220;Use light-coloured paint inside your house. Dark wall colours absorb light, increasing the amount of lighting needed.&#8221;  
**Revolutionary.** Sorry, I shouldn&#8217;t be so sarcastic&#8230; this is a good point. I&#8217;m not sure whether the wall colours magically absorb light or simply fail to reflect it. Or if there&#8217;s even a difference between the two. I&#8217;m all out of smart-arse ammo on this point.

&#8220;Modern dimmer controls reduce greenhouse gas emissions as they reduce light output. They also extend lamp life.&#8221;  
**Debunked above.** Stupid consumers aside, I think there&#8217;s probably a decent-sized question of efficiency here, also. How about you just buy lower wattage globes to start with?

&#8220;Use desk lamps or standard lamps where light is most needed, so less lighting is required in the rest of the room.&#8221;  
**Huh?** What, the desk lamps you can&#8217;t buy CF fittings for? People use too-high wattage incandescent globes (60W-ish) or still-too-high wattage halogens (20W), and then proceed to have two or three on to compensate. I&#8217;ve seen it happen. You can get some appropriate low-wattage fittings for this purpose (standard fluoros or, sometimes, screw/bayonet CFs if the lamp supports it) but I&#8217;m still doubting the practical helpfulness of this one.

&#8220;Keep lamps and fittings clean: dirt build-up will reduce light output over time.&#8221;  
**Good call.** Especially with really high wattage fixtures (theatre luminaires can often do with a good wiping down!) Equally, this applies to windows. Seriously. If you&#8217;re stuck in an old, musty church building and are having trouble seeing, go clean a few stained-glass windows. You don&#8217;t notice the grime as readily as you would with clear windows, but it will definitely make a difference if they ever get hit by sunlight (and even if they don&#8217;t). Particularly this applies if you&#8217;re near any major roads.

&#8220;Use daylight instead of artificial lights â€“ but do not overdo it. Large windows and skylights add to summer heat and winter cold.&#8221;  
**Yup.** This ties in to my last point.

So, take government fact sheets with a grain of salt. I don&#8217;t know whether the document was written by well-intentioned public servants or misinformed, wildly-optimistic hippies, but the fact remains it seems to miss a fair few key problems/misrepresents a handful of things. And yes, I&#8217;ve probably misrepresented things, too&#8230; I can get away with it because I&#8217;m just an opinionated blogger/Arts student &#8212; they&#8217;re supposedly the authority. So if I&#8217;ve got anything wrong be gentle ;-)
