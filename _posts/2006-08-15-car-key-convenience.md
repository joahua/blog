We finally got around to getting dupes made of car key after the ignition lock thingy broke and we had to get it replaced. So now there is more than one shared car key between three occasional drivers, which is excellent. Not so excellent is that I nearly broke my keyring putting it on, because Honda make seriously obese keys, but no matter. I have a key now. \*is happy\*
