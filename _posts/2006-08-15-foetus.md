Seven weeks: able to feel and respond to stimulus.  
Sixteen weeks: able to hear even whilst the pinna is still forming.  
Seventeen weeks: skin sensitivity in most of body.

Twenty-four weeks: legal abortion in NSW, Australia, without any need for proof of danger to mother or child.

We know the seventeen weeks figure for skin sensitivity from testing on &#8216;aborted&#8217; (but still alive &#8212; and interestingly acknowledged as &#8220;living&#8221;) foetuses. Seriously. I don&#8217;t know how the experiments go exactly, but I reckon it&#8217;s something along the lines of &#8220;hey, let&#8217;s prod the unborn child and see what happens!&#8221; (semi-sarcastic tone). Sigh.

Half of this education course seems to be about the best way(s) to scar and kill children. It&#8217;s interesting in a really scary kind of way.
