will be a productive day. I will wake up before 8, be dressed + have eaten breakfast + functional by 9, start ingesting video from TACKLES sleepover last Saturday (NOT on a Linux computer, because even Ubuntu doesn&#8217;t play nice with Firewire cards, it seems), call a friend I&#8217;ve been meaning to call for too long and generally stop procrastinating on that front whilst the video thingy is at work (I bought a Firewire cable so will hopefully never again have to capture from analogue sources where I don&#8217;t absolutely need to), and call another friend accordingly, based upon the outcome of the first, prod the Matthias site a little bit (blog goodness for those who are keen on it!), hopefully return a video camera if Adam is home (otherwise leave voicemail and deal with it all later, I suppose), return home, email check (compulsively, as if there were any other way), eat lunch, go to work, work, get home, contemplate dealing with captured video and decide it&#8217;s too hard without iMovie/Premiere/something less painful/more powerful than Windows Movie Maker/less gargantuan/buggy/UI-designed-by-primates than Cinelerra, email compulsively some more, chase some lights, put off til weekend (when everywhere will be closed anyway), stay at home for once, sleep (before midnight).

Noticing a downwards Getting-Stuff-Done trend. Meh. Lecture is cancelled tomorrow so I&#8217;ve got more time to try and be productive in. Now I&#8217;ve just got to not wake up too late&#8230; not even the 372 will save me if it&#8217;s not a going-to-uni day (haven&#8217;t had one of those in a while now, nice!)
