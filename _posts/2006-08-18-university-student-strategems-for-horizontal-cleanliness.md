1.  Wear clothes.
2.  Remove clothes periodically. Once every several days should suffice.
3.  Having removed clothes, strategically project aforementioned attire upon some unsuspecting, otherwise-clear, patch of floor.
4.  Repeat for a moderate period of time (n.b. period of time determined by the interval specified in #2, above)
5.  Await absence of clean (or acceptably deodorisable) clothing.
6.  Decide it is time to act: in sweeping manoeuver, collect items of apparel from floor and relocate for purposes of washing &#8212; or, in extreme cases, incineration.

The advantages of this technique are manifold. However, for the purposes of brevity, I will promulgate but two here:

1.  That, in behaving thus, one should remove the need for a permanent carpet. Accordingly, vacuuming disappears entirely from the vocabulary of necessity, as this &#8216;carpet&#8217; can be not only removed and cleaned at whim &#8212; and in parts! &#8212; but is, on the whole, already considered to be dirty and, as such, the idea of vacuuming that which was dirty upon &#8216;installation&#8217; is, self-evidently, absurd.
2.  That, in continuation of the floor-covering theme, upon removal at periodic intervals, one may readily enjoy a clean surface that lies beneath, which has been not only protected from the maladies of day-to-day exposure; it has, in accordance with the &#8220;sweeping manoeuver&#8221; alluded to above, been also immediately dusted and revealed as a vast, undiscovered expanse.

It stands to reason, therefore, that all other manners of habitation are vastly inferior, substituting true efficiency for an illusion of cleanliness &#8212; which could, in fact, be no further from the truth &#8212; outshone by the innumerable advantages offered by such a &#8216;slovenly&#8217; (thus spake the accusers) mode of living.

As an addendum, let it be acknowledged that much of the above theory is wholly dependent upon the looseness of deposit: that is, folded clothes are no-where near as efficient in their capturing, covering, and sweeping capabilities, and should accordingly be avoided insofar as is possible for effective application of the above theories.
