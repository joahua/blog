One day they will run out and all will stop pretending the illusion is anything but that. Tomorrow is a monster-day (8am to ~8pm or later, with few breaks), but the week goes uphill (well&#8230; tomorrow isn&#8217;t bad, just crazy) after that. Thank goodness for other people being just as erratic as I. One day this will all get better, but not while I am pretending to have control over matters. Really, really I don&#8217;t. Need to keep submitting to and being transformed by God&#8217;s word, and eventually&#8230; can&#8217;t wait.
