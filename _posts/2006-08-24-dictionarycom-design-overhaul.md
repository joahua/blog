I&#8217;m so excited. I visit this site daily just because it&#8217;s the easiest address to remember (fingers automatically type: dicti^T ^H^H^H^H[keyword] in browser), and it&#8217;s far nicer on the eyes now. Minimal web-2.0 shadows, etc., but the top bit looks kinda ripped from the WordPress admin interface ;-) No, typography is the big thing for me. It&#8217;s just nice. Little changes like that (for it&#8217;s a simple enough site, aesthetically) make web experiences fantastic.

Now, if only they secured a decent non-American dictionary, I&#8217;d become a Premium member for that reason alone. Right now there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d bother for aural pronounciation aids and seemingly little else! (I have a pop-up blocker built into Opera and near-absolute immunity to banner ads)
