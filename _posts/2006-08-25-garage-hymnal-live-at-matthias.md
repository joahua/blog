Good times in a bizarre concert/congregational mixed genre kinda way. More photos coming. Maybe not of the organ on fire&#8230; If only we&#8217;d have thought of that sooner I&#8217;d have rigged some piping up so it could have been evenly distributed! Ah well. It was the closest you&#8217;re likely to get to Hillsong in a very Anglican Evangelical church for a while, I&#8217;d say! Also, whilst I&#8217;d generally post photos tonight I&#8217;m getting/am sick *and* have to be up at 6am to contribute heavily to global warming tomorrow (not in a livestock kind of way) at central-nowhere (aka Cobbitty&#8230; yeah, exactly! I think it&#8217;s near where Kristen reportedly lives, but am uncertain). So&#8230; they&#8217;re coming, promise. Flickr&#8217;ll get a workout (as will the remainder of this month&#8217;s quota&#8211;not capped yet, but quite ready to change that!)

Yay :)
