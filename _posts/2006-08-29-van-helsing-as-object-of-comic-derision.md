The notion itself seems laughable. The proposition of a progression from &#8216;normality&#8217; to &#8216;comedy&#8217; to horror as one travels eastwards (from England in Stoker&#8217;s *Dracula*) seems&#8230; well, itself very foreign. Only not foreign in any substantiable kind of way, more in a &#8220;you lied about where you went when on holidays, didn&#8217;t you&#8221; scenario. His language is reflective firstly of his foreignness, but this foreignness is less modern, and more attuned to the powers of &#8220;old Europe&#8221; than England perhaps is. We see modernity through a distinctly British lense, whereby competing powers are completely marginalised and it is all reduced (seemingly) to a dichotomous struggle between heritage and contemporary being. It will be noted, also, that until the twelvth century or thereabouts (maybe later, even), England/Ireland/Scotland/Wales were considered as barbarous and undeveloped as the (Far East) and Muslim powers&#8230; modernity splits this, perhaps, into future potential versus present as-yet-undefeated currency of being (I love that phrase, Communist influences or not) in a sense of antiquity.

Also, one mustn&#8217;t make the mistake of confusing antiquity as lineage. MH&#8217;s first lecture drew attention to &#8216;the whirlpool of European races&#8217; in Dracula&#8217;s third chapter (though I wasn&#8217;t at the lecture, it&#8217;s online in Powerpoint format) which, notably, refers only to continental European influences. There is preserved an irrevocable distinction between &#8216;Europe&#8217; (which, it seems, is an old power without the same sense of embracing modernity &#8212; notably Germany and Russia are generally ignored in this text) and &#8216;England&#8217; (even including America, by a character link).

Helsing is still &#8216;other&#8217;. His otherness is not that of cheap laughs, but of blended encounters with savage forces lurking further to the East. (IMO, of course :))
