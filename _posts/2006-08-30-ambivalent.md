![Blown away flower][1]

One of those weather-ambivalent days. It wasn&#8217;t an ambivalent time when I took the photo but what it depicts is&#8230; bedraggled Dandelion clock foreground with brighter flora in an uncertain background, whilst the photo itself was bright (or at least washed-out and very digital looking) and my edited version is rather more foreboding (or deep/feels like film grain). So there&#8217;s some over-explanation for a rainy day.
