Yes, that is in the middle of the Quad building. (Yes, it is taken at night&#8230; 9.20ish). No, this doesn&#8217;t happen every night, but even so&#8230; there was some kind of musical performance going on in the Great Hall and all I could think of was that it was some strange kind of cult gathering! All very strange.
