Oh my goodness. Why didn&#8217;t I go to Google sooner? All that time trawling through books and ERIC and Gale DBs, wasted!

I could have even hit I&#8217;m feeling lucky. I&#8217;M FEELING FREAKIN&#8217; UNLUCKY! Number 1 match for &#8220;adolescent emotional development&#8221; (entered not out of desparation but simply on a whim this evening to see what it turned up! I&#8217;ll confess I was expecting angsty blog entries from some more-erudite teenagers rather than actual research.) unveils a brilliant overview page from an Assoc. Prof. at Queen&#8217;s Uni (Canada)&#8217;s developmental psychology department, which is incredibly well supported with citations, etc.

I should quit this whole uni/vocational dealing-with-people-and-books gig right now and go back to my little geek world in which Google knows all and Wikipedia can be *read* without fear of violent reprisals from the faculty thought-police. The two are converging! It&#8217;s like those cheesy rooms in movies with spikes on the walls that couldn&#8217;t realistically kill you properly because of the ridiculously large space between spikes that makes scaling the wall possible! And now I&#8217;ve stopped whining and am just procrastinating.
