Continuing in the spirit of procrastination, I know, but I couldn&#8217;t help noticing all the awesome things ABC (that is, Australian taxpayer-funded TV/media network&#8230; nothing to do with American network of same name) are doing with their various brands. The most stand-out example in this sense, of course, is their tech-saavied&#8217;up youth/new-fandangle-embracing market service, Triple J. But they&#8217;re doing funky podcast stuff with the rest of their network, too. Anyway, JTV is exciting and cool. ABC&#8217;s lawyers must be the kindest, most understanding souls on the planet. And/or Triple J&#8217;s &#8216;casters are universally sensitive to copyrighted materials and all quite sedate and non-rebellious in a corporately rebellious sense. One of the two groups must be great team players, at any rate. Alternatively, we&#8217;ve got some awesome loophole in our copyright law/acts relevant to a national broadcaster absolving them of all fiscal responsibilities. But then there&#8217;s the question of why there&#8217;s no production music in live segments&#8230; and I don&#8217;t accept lack of quality on-air/production talent as an excuse, because that&#8217;s just not true. Certainly the talent is quite different from that on the commercial nets, but that just means the presenters are allowed to have an opinion and a brain much of the time. Maybe proximity-to-Inner-West has been affecting my tastes somewhat, but the dial (or, in this case, Rhythmbox&#8217;s stream) is getting stuck here more often of late.

Maybe we&#8217;re finally getting citizen media saavy enough to appreciate what they&#8217;ve been doing for the last however many years as finally &#8216;cool&#8217;. Which kinda ties into the idea of positive freedom in a Renaissance sense. But that has nothing (or little) to do with adolescent emotional development, even if it&#8217;s relevant for another pres due next Tuesday. So I&#8217;ll stress about that later on =)
