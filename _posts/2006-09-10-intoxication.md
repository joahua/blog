I just tried [Wine][1] again for the first time in about twelve months (last attempt was with eTax, useless IE-dependent thing that it is, last year. After a bit of configging it worked but couldn&#8217;t submit because of that dependency&#8230; it saved a data file I could submit with Windows, though) and am astounded.

After zero-config, installers work magically, 3d engines function, and everything is generally incredible. I read this on [someone&#8217;s blog][2] earlier today: &#8220;with that I was able to install the latest Wine (0.9.18 at the time of this writing). This comes with better support for HL2 and WoW.&#8221; and consequently was afraid the version in non-backports Ubuntu would be ancient, etcetera, and generally useless.

No, the author is correct in saying &#8220;better support&#8221; &#8212; there is intrinsically fantastic support for pretty much everything. It&#8217;s incredible. Now I&#8217;ve just got to get some time in which to play various games. Linux, apparently, is no longer a barrier to entry, and Loki Games (R.I.P.) would face an ever-diminishing challenge as compatability layers keep growing in their sheer brilliance.

I&#8217;ve yet to try productivity applications, but am content with having tentatively embraced the gamer side of geek for one weekend. I&#8217;d love to give Dreamweaver a whirl, but am unlikely to be doing enough development work to justify it for the next couple of months. MS Office would be a pleasant addition to the repertoire, though OpenOffice is excellent for most applications. I&#8217;d never go back to using Word for preparing real documents, but perhaps for things requiring collaboration/versioning it&#8217;s the best choice. I&#8217;d probably get MS Office for creating Powerpoint templates/editing other people&#8217;s work before I had any real need for it myself, so these things are still pretty unnecessary. It&#8217;s just fantastic to think that it is, all of a sudden, a possibility.

The irony of all this is that I&#8217;m waxing lyrical about closed-source apps when the actual intent of this post is to extoll the brilliance of F/OSS&#8217;s progress. Purists would argue otherwise&#8230; but they&#8217;re wrong :-)
