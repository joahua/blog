[New laws target modchip users][1], and, you know, everyone else.

Two steps forward, three steps backwards. I can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re being dragged into this crap. Slightly too angry about this (yeah I knew it was coming but hadn&#8217;t had occasion to address it) to blog rationally about the issue &#8212; insert usual remarks about my illegal downloading and installation of DVD CSS circumvention software, SharpMusique, etcetera, and the general criminalisation of broadly compatible open source software.

So apparently I cop five years in prison if I share some de CSS software with someone so they can watch content they&#8217;ve paid for. Guess what the maximum term for copyright violation is? Yeah, five years. Bastards. Solution: Download pirated versions of content that have broader compatability, exposing yourself to the same extent for vastly less effort.
