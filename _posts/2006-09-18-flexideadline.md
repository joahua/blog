Don&#8217;t you love it when you realise something is due two weeks later than you thought it was going to be? Assessment workload for this week just went back down to a nearly-sane level. Now the I&#8217;ve just got to worry (if that&#8217;s the right word) about finally starting a new job on Thursday&#8230; but most concern about that is linked to the fact I have an assessment due that day (in conjunction with a tendency to do things a little last minute!) Ah well, nothing unusual there.
