I just realised I own about one pair of shorts. (Not including two pairs of boardies). Everything else is jeans, trackies or zip-off pants (which end up looking kinda like shorts but aren&#8217;t, really). Maybe that&#8217;s why I love this edge of summer (call it spring, whatever): I can get away with wearing the same clothes more often because there&#8217;s only a really a few days warm enough to require shorts. Nice.
