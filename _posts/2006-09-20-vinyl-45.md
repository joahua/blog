On its way from Victoria late next week. Is it bad that I have a name for it already?

![Vinyl 45][1]

It&#8217;s going to kick some serious butt, and hopefully the fact it&#8217;s arriving later in the week will mean that I can spend a few lazy days earlier in the mid-semester break reading books and chilling at the beach/in parks/generally being a uni bum/arts hippie. Then I&#8217;ll hopefully not want to go back and this new half-kilowatt flamethrower will be used sparingly around study and real-world engagements.

Either way, this puppy should do nicely for at least the next five years.
