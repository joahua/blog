But I seem to have a habit of internally overstating deadlines. [Yet another one][1] due two weeks later than thought! Woot. So now it&#8217;s just English, which is (insert superlative for &#8216;wonderful&#8217; here). Even so, off to uni I go to collect an assessment very helpfully available for collection only in the middle of mid-semester &#8216;break&#8217;&#8230; at least I don&#8217;t have anything due, unlike some other faculties/years.
