Hours/Kilometers travelled for a magical chunk of silicon we like to call &#8216;teh b0xxen&#8217;.

I picked up a perspex case and an absolutely kick-arse [Pioneer DV-344 DVD player][1]. It&#8217;s region 4 only, which sucks, and no RGB output, which also sucks &#8212; there&#8217;s YPbPr though. On the good side, a 118dB SNR with 0.0016% THD means it sounds pretty darn good. Only stereo analogue output, but I don&#8217;t care too much about that&#8230; there&#8217;s optical digital output if surround is required. Seeing as I fairly literally &#8216;found&#8217; this, there&#8217;s no remote&#8230; which is a little bit of a bummer but whatever. I mostly wanted it for CD playback (\*listens to Steve crying\* &#8212; shut up, it sounds freakin&#8217; excellent) so it&#8217;s no biggie. However, on the video playback side of things, it&#8217;s absolutely wonderful for events in that it doesn&#8217;t have any stupidly conspicuous Pioneer splash screens, etc., instead sporting only text-based &#8220;Play/Pause/Stop/Open/Eject&#8221; titles. The default background colour is black. So that&#8217;s rather magnificent. It doesn&#8217;t even have a screensaver so it&#8217;s quite safe for use pretty much everywhere. A thing of beauty indeed.

Speaking of things of beauty, Selo&#8217;s computer (3800+ DC 939, Asus A8N-SLI, 1GB Kingmax DDR400 (512MBx2), 6800GS PCI-E, Lightscribe DVD-RW, 120GB, 300GB, 19&#8243; Fujitsu 8ms) is hawt. Heh, especially the Leadtek 6800GS ;-) Gonna need that Fujitsu screen to cool things down eh? Okay, enough of the airconditioner jokes! It&#8217;s actually quite good. But his case is pretty banged up after being wedged in the boot of a BMW for a couple of months (seller = affluent IT support dude that sells few-months-old hardware for cheap!)

Anyway no photos yet because my camera is on loan to Budd who will return it soon (or else :)) and then there&#8217;ll probably be a couple. Something rather shiny should be arriving later this week for me, and there&#8217;ll be probably photos aplenty of that.

In other acquisitive news, I came by a Sony 4&#215;4&#8243; PVM-411CE for cheap (timecode screen burn, really minor) last week and it&#8217;s doing fantastically. It&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;ve actually been able to see DVD output from this player thing and hopefully it&#8217;ll mean I need to carry (and, as a prerequisite to that, beg/borrow/steal) less TVs for various applications.
