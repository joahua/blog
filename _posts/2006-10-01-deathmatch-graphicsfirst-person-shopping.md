It just occurred to me that, to anyone listening from the other side of a wall whilst I&#8217;m using Photoshop, GIMP, Inkscape, Illustrator etc., it would sound an awful like I&#8217;m fragging the crap out of people. Ignoring, for a moment, the inconvenient problems of HF loss through walls (let&#8217;s say they&#8217;re blind and standing nearby, or the walls are made from paper), and the fact that I&#8217;m not that good at Counter-Strike to start with (and consequently after a minute or two of fragging sounds they should anticipate a sigh and then a cessation of clicking that just isn&#8217;t forthcoming with most graphics work).

Frag on, you crazy designers.
