It must be crap. This thing is finished nine hours early! Cruising! The language is a bit all over the place, but it&#8217;s all in english, and the content is a bit year-11-and-12-rehash in places, but it&#8217;s mostly pretty alright (lots of Bahktinian self/other stuff going on, not that I actually thought to mention his name).

In other news I&#8217;m really hoping my new PC rocks up today. And that I have money to pay for the damn thing. We&#8217;ll see how it goes; if not today, tomorrow. Then I&#8217;ve got to get a copy of XP Pro and then I&#8217;ll be lost to RTS games for a few weeks. Sigh \*good sigh\*
