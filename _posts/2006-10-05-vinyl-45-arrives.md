It&#8217;s here.

DFI LanParty UT NForce4 SLI-DR VENUS, AMD 64bit 3200+ (939) @ 2.4GHz, 2GB (2 x 1GB DIMMS) OCZ Platinum DDR PC4000, 256MB GeForce 7600GS PCIe, 250GB Sata2 Seagate, Pioneer DVD Combi drive, OCZ Powerstream 520 Watts&#8230; and XP Pro still sucks. Necessary evils, I suppose. 2221 3DMark &#8217;06, don&#8217;t remember &#8217;05 score.

All this firepower and I&#8217;m sitting here playing seven-year-old RTS games anyway. Sigh :P Next stop, another hard drive (just so I don&#8217;t have system/data on same disk&#8230; I&#8217;d complain about the pagefile &#8212; wow it&#8217;s weird calling a swap partition that &#8212; but somehow with 2GBs of tasty memory &#8212; mmm brains &#8212; that shouldn&#8217;t be too much of a concern just yet ;-)).

Also, I&#8217;m rather sold on the dual core myth so if anyone has an X2 939 they&#8217;re trying to get rid of&#8230; PWTB. Not that I need it right now so it&#8217;ll wait a while. I&#8217;m planning on saving again and getting some decent video hardware to go with my new Sony PVM-411CE :-)

I&#8217;ve got some case mods planned but am thinking they&#8217;re going to have to wait until summer break for reasons of time and money. And it&#8217;s now 1.30 in the morning and I&#8217;ve got to be up in five and a half hours. Doh&#8230; computers suck.
