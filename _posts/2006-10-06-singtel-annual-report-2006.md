It uses the term SMS exactly once. MMS doesn&#8217;t get a mention, and, just to make sure it&#8217;s not a parochial thing, I checked for PXT as well&#8230; also no mention. If anyone has any good stats on messenging by Australian mobile SPs please leave a comment. Telstra are great, Optus/SGT are not so great. Clearly as an annual report it should be more than fluff followed by some financial boringness. Competitive analysis, etc., would surely be not a bad thing to have in there. Mind you, weighing in at 192 pages, there&#8217;s a lot of fluff already.
