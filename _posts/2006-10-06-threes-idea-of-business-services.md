![Apache holder page on Three's Business site][1]

Oh, what was that? The sound of money going away from Three again? Yeah, maybe. I think I have this effect on them, I bet the site was working fine until five minutes before I tried to access it. Or maybe Three just suck. ;-)

Clearly, real businesses don&#8217;t run open source software. (Just thought I&#8217;d throw that into the mix before Steve got here ;-) I&#8217;m also allowed to say that now, having reverted to the Dark Side with Vinyl 45!)
