A very useful programme for when you just can&#8217;t be stuffed reaching across to the phone sitting a few centimeters away from you on the desk ;-) Or, for those of us who manage to not notice a phone going off less than a meter away from their head, but will be instantly bugged beyond belief by a popup alert on their screen into responding. My SMS response rate has got nearly as bad as my email followups this last couple of weeks, so it&#8217;s probably helpful.

Oh, and it&#8217;s also useful for &#8216;backing up&#8217; (yeah yeah, onsite = bad, etc.) /copying/pasting URLs, etc. in SMS. [Jeyo][2] doesn&#8217;t do MMS/PXT at all which is a bit of a bummer but it&#8217;s quite cool apart from that. I&#8217;m still deciding if it&#8217;s worth twenty bucks (Australian).

It operates through ActiveSync so you&#8217;ve got to have that going as well&#8230; which you probably would anyway if you own a PDA in any way associated with a desktop PC (weird \*nix/mac types excepted &#8211; but as if Mac users would use anything other than a Palm! Well, maybe Blackberry have a foot in there, but it&#8217;s probably too corporate for them hippies &#8211; tongue firmly in cheek). It kinda bugs me that this functionality isn&#8217;t available for free from someone, actually, but whatever.

I can now send SMS for ~15Â¢ Australian through Skype, for ~5Â½Â¢ (real cost) using my mobile through Outlook 2002, or wait til people are on MSN and then send them whatever for free. Clearly, we pay for convenience. And don&#8217;t really value sub-gold-coin amounts of money.
