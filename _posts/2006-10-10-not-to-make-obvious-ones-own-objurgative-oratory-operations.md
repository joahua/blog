&#8230;but (just quietly), I made this evening the [ludicrous comment][1] of which I am most proud thus far over at Erin&#8217;s LiveJournal (that sentence intentionally turgid). It is clearly the work of one equipped with a good dictionary&#8230; for that I make no apologies. I only challenge you to discover the meaning of &#8220;pampining&#8221; using anything but the OED. Yes, the comment does make a tangential sort of sense once you decipher the words. No, the meaning isn&#8217;t anything particularly deep. This is why I love the ridiculousness of the English language!
