I&#8217;m installing it now, this is so completely painless. And, it even offers an [Esperanto][1] dictionary via aspell!! I suppose open-source gurus are prone to obscurity, hey ;-)

It&#8217;s downloading ImageMagick and GhostScript (hopefully AFPL&#8230; no, wait, they&#8217;ve now caught up the GPL version! Yay!)&#8230; at a meagre speed because it&#8217;s a net-based installer. But this is free. And open-source. And they have net-based installers. And it found my already-installed MiKTeX! Instant cool factor. Maybe this Windows gig isn&#8217;t so bad afterall. (On second thoughts, I haven&#8217;t tried to get it to run yet, this is just the installer&#8230; It&#8217;ll probably be all fun and games til I try and change the dictionary from Afrikaans to English&#8230; or Esperanto&#8230; not that I speak it, but whatever). 

Meanwhile, I just discovered I somehow have random papercut-esque things all over one of my fingers. Bizarre. Almost as bizarre as my benefitting from the work of open source on Windows as much as I do. Quite odd, indeed.
