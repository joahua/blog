Cut down the trees and build more houses whilst shooting dissident journalists in democratic states and ignoring the event as bombs explode in mountains with Tibetans praying to a man as they fall in gunfire (also ignored, this time in the name of commerce). Closer to home (and the Internet), media ownership becomes homogenous, citizen media comes in above citizen justice, flag-theft is confused with flag-immolation in every major media outlet (some make the decision buried beneath sensationalist headlines) and second chances are met with splattered egg yolk, and irrational rampages leave streets of broken glass without message.

On the plus side, I got a free lunch today.
