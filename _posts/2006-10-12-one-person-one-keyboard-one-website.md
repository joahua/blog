> WordPress is about writing on the web. It&#8217;s about publishing. It&#8217;s not about editing video, it&#8217;s not *necessarily* about content management, it&#8217;s not, you know, about building communities of tens of thousands of people. It&#8217;s really one person, one keyboard, one website.

And he reckons this was with him struggling to stay awake. I didn&#8217;t actually think I&#8217;d ever end up quoting this guy on my blog, but whatever. It&#8217;s a really helpful statement. It&#8217;s an uncomfortable statement for me, personally, because I&#8217;d love to use WordPress as a CMS for loads of stuff (even though, deep down, I know it would never really scale at all) and WordPress MU for loads more stuff (if it didn&#8217;t kinda suck)&#8230; but at the same time it&#8217;s easier hearing it from the horse&#8217;s mouth. There is a certain sense in which this gives an emancipation from product loyalty in certain senses, and another sense in which it gives me a kick to develop/find a decent CMS (framework) from which to launch other things.

I spend half a day looking at forward edges of the avalanch that is the web and want to quit uni and go freelance. (But I&#8217;m biased until next Thursday&#8230;)
