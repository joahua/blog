I was sure I&#8217;d blogged about this [open-source AJAX email platform thingy][1] in the past, but apparently not. No matter. They used to be all about their AJAXy web interface (my impression, as is always the case here) but now seem to have dropped that and are running along the open-source-for-corporates track that seems to work so well these days. Checking out their key customers and technology partners would suggest they&#8217;re definitely doing something right, and it&#8217;s beyond the shininess of their website.

Modest gradients, no shadows, occasional (even rare) curves (logo excepted, but I think the logo sucks/is childish so whatever), and tables for layout.

Oh, wait&#8230;
