<p>Or maybe I&#8217;m just getting excited about programming again. I just discovered <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a>, and have decided that Python is a seriously underrated language. It&#8217;s probably as high-level as Rails, only all the cool <em>and</em> successful kids (that is to say, the ones that have been around a little longer than Basecamp. Not to fling mud at Basecamp, but I just don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d want to fully embrace a framework that&#8217;s so-much-more-than-a-framework &#8212; because, let&#8217;s face it, who had heard of Ruby before Rails?) are using it.</p>
<p>Part of the appeal is possibly the name. Di-jang-go. Di-jun-go. Say it with me (either way). *yells &#8220;jumanji&#8221; and hopes no-one notices*</p>
<p>It looks unfortunately web 2.0 but no matter, hopefully it&#8217;s useful. I remain by no stretch of the imagination a programmer. It&#8217;s been too bloody long since I even pretended. Maybe it&#8217;s time to start again (only after next Thursday, after writing and researching three large-ish asssessments).</p>
