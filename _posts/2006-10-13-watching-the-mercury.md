I just realised it was hot outside by monitoring the temperature of hard drives in a computer at home. It&#8217;s comfortably cool where I am now (in a web-monkey bunker deep in the heart of Sydney&#8217;s CBD) but apparently not at home&#8230; whisper&#8217;s poor hard drives just hit 60 degrees! \*sniff\*

Yeah yeah, I know, such a geek&#8230;
