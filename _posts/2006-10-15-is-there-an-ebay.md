Catch-all Adwords campaigns really backfire at times. Insert essay about consumerism as modern god here.

I saw the link on my Dictionary.com search (I still use it because it&#8217;s so much quicker+easier to understand than the OED at times, and I figure I&#8217;m only visiting because my brain is already cooking so there&#8217;s no point making things worse &#8212; who *really* knew what ontologically meant? Be honest&#8230;) and couldn&#8217;t help but click it, wondering who was paying for AdSense trying to convince people there is/isn&#8217;t a God (arguing that there is makes sense, but what gain is there in convincing people there isn&#8217;t?)&#8230; ah, eBay, of course.
