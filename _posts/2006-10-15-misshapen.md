Percept what? Untitled paradigms gain clarity, Shaped as cliche, evolving til their fall.

Then, again, exemplar touchstones arise But for these followers, there is no prototype.

Redefinitional struggle breaks as fungus creeps towards a new rock onto which it will silently attach.

Then rain falls and finds itself channelled across previously benign surfaces. Clinging and seeping into the depths.

It nourishes insidiousness alone: the cathartic purity promised of it is but an illusion. Bathing in filth.

But the poison was never added, only grown. This agar plate plays host to a spreading disesase.

So the blackened glass obscures light, the powdered poison coating every surface.

The core has suffocated itself. It might not have seen it coming but its will was its own.

Invention plays with light but suddenly it has blown out itself as glowing winds are &#8216;harnessed&#8217;.

As though there were control.

As though shapes on the wall played comfortably in the dim light.

It only takes a flicker.
