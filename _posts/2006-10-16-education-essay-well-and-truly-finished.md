Quite happy with that. Now I&#8217;m going to go and read myself to sleep and then bounce back up not-too-late tomorrow morning and churn out&#8230; 400 words an hour. It&#8217;s waffly political crap (borderline philosophy, quasi-historical) so I&#8217;m looking forward to it. What I&#8217;m *not* looking forward to is *finishing* it, getting it handed in, and then realising there are no fun assessments left. Looking at this Language and Image assessment is like watching a tidal wave approaching when you&#8217;re ten kilometers out to sea in a kayak (Which is code for, I need a drink). But, anyway, enough about that.

Education has had its butt sufficiently kicked (alas, no &#8220;In soviet Russia, butt kicks you!&#8221; style sentences were had, despite Vygotsky and <del>his band of merry men</del> the Kharkovians being great Soviet fun for all the family, except for Stalin&#8217;s son, who was apparently deficient and daddy resultingly banned Vygotsky&#8217;s work for a bloody long time), though I was somewhat disappointed that the faculty only likes APA style citation. Sigh. Anyone would think that education is actually practical or something, psscchtt. I pulled out the MLA Handbook (fourth edition, because fifth only adds online citation info &#8212; and, honestly, who would cite a website? &#8212; and because it was dirt cheap (well, okay, about half price) and I&#8217;m nerdy enough to want to own one) just for comparative kicks. Well, that and I wanted it handy for starting history. Should be good times.
