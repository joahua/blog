Well, where chocolate milkshake = work of fiction. There is a reason I wrote my extension 2 major work in the same amount of time it took for me to write two essays coming to only half of its size! But uni is more fun, if slightly more work. I will keep using the f- word to try and fool myself into thinking that Thursday&#8217;s one won&#8217;t be so bad. It is starting tomorrow, after a relatively-relaxing history lecture.

Anyway I&#8217;ll probably stick essays up online in a day or two, not too soon because of the stupidly low late penalties our uni has which would make opportunistic plagiarism of that sort quite simple to execute. Quite simpler to defend from my perspective once they discovered it (if), but whatever :P

Now&#8230; geek time!
