<p>New ad from <a href="http://www.bravia-advert.com/">Sony Bravia</a>. The Sony brand doesn&#8217;t get much of a work out this time around, it&#8217;s only displayed separately from the Bravia and &#8220;like no other&#8221; brands. It seems they&#8217;re linking like no other and Bravia more with this campaign? Anyway, it&#8217;s great test-reel fodder with a 720 HD download available from their site. Only 90 seconds, I&#8217;m hoping they&#8217;re going to release a longer one. As with <a href="http://www.bravia-advert.com/balls/">the last one</a>, the making-of is worth watching. I actually found it way more emotive than the slightly-austere real thing, because there was a cheering crew (of 200!!) and crowd and real explosion sounds. The real ad is brilliant, sure, but the making-of is more moving.</p>
