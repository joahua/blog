How is this going to get any better? No longer running over a whiteboard because there&#8217;s not that much content to go around. I don&#8217;t even like the idea of this, everything was just founded upon some presupposition that things were meant to be easier than they are. Which they aren&#8217;t. So it wasn&#8217;t. So I&#8217;m wrong. And its midday. I&#8217;m getting sunburnt whilst typing.

Can&#8217;t. Win. This. Week.

Pick the real clause. One of them is, I think. Whatever. Just over it.

Not even afraid of getting it wrong because I already have and it doesn&#8217;t seem to make anything perceptibly worse. Now it&#8217;s just broken things strewn everywhere. The wreckage of now.
