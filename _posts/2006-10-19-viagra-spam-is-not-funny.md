So stop pretending it is. If you&#8217;re going to try and slip it past heuristics (machine or me) by including human humour, how about just trying it once. Your humour will not slip past me because I find it more amusing on twenty-seventh reading. My default moderate action is delete all, then approve if it looks human (and then I check to see if it actually makes sense). I&#8217;ve thus-far refrained from using [Akismet][1], but think I&#8217;m probably producing more false-positives than it would. Then again, absolutely [nothing is getting through that shouldn&#8217;t][2], so in a way that&#8217;s a good thing.

Not in the mood for jokes, today, especially where they&#8217;re jokes unleashed upon the world by the rotting claws of rats resting upon keyboards.

I know I bitch about this every few months, but that&#8217;s because it hasn&#8217;t gone away yet. And because I get to dance a small victory, because it hasn&#8217;t become effective yet, either. Propulsion by small things.
