Hahaha. I just rang a font company to enquire after a product. They told me that it&#8217;d been stuck in customs for two weeks and they couldn&#8217;t do anything about it yet (this is a 3KG, ~1,800 page, hardcover book. You&#8217;d think it&#8217;d make more sense to print here, but whatever!)

Terrorists fonts, perhaps.
