So I&#8217;ve had this PC for however long I&#8217;ve had it now, and still haven&#8217;t installed Quicktime. As in, I haven&#8217;t been putting it off, and I&#8217;ve been watching plenty of Quicktime content, but I just haven&#8217;t seen the need to. As in, it didn&#8217;t cross my mind. Because I can install VLC in a matter of seconds with out worrying about annoying &#8220;upgrade to pro&#8221; prompts or battling the website to let me download a version without full-of-DRM-style-crap music library player wossit. Whatever happened to Nullsoft/Winamp, anyway? I&#8217;ve been stuck on a little island called &#8220;open-source&#8221; (it has penguins but is strangely not that uncomfortable) for a couple of years&#8230; then this massive cruise liner came along and picked me up and offered to take me home for about $200. I didn&#8217;t get a glossy brochure about the cruise but it&#8217;s functionally the same, and now I&#8217;m back home wondering what transpired in my absence. Do people still use that thing? Anyway, whatever. Quicktime in the official sense seems kinda redundant with the exception of good/easy browser integration. The end.
