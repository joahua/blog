I decided to move across the room, the headphones fairly solidly plugged in (around a desk and a block of marble) had fairly different ideas. Desk accoutrements went flying, headphones remained firmly tethered, Josh sustains whiplash. It&#8217;s like a seatbelt for your head only really, really, not.

The solution? Either a printer situated upstairs so the tray output falls down to me (nifty but occasionally irritating) or wireless headphones (and, really, I get enough Bluetooth/mobile/whatever else radiation as it is). Or just buying less comfy headphones so I don&#8217;t forget they&#8217;re situated on my head. The ones at present keep my ears warm. Yes, even with this much hair my ears get cold. Yes, nearly in summer after heat waves. Yes, my circulation is that bad, etc. Shut up and leave me to strangle myself with a headphone cord.
