According to [this guy][1], anyway.

> Smoking increases the risk of lung diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. These progressive lung diseases â€“ grouped under the term COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) â€“ are usually diagnosed in current or former smokers in their 60s and 70s. COPD causes chronic illness and disability and is eventually fatal.

Don&#8217;t know average stats on heart disease, but I bet if I were to start smoking today, I&#8217;d be set. ;-)
