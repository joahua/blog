This is such a generic geek/pseudo-designery blog post, so I&#8217;m really sorry to subject everyone to it (truly), but how much does the limited scope of typography *suck*?! I&#8217;m just wishing there were more/better choices to be had. I&#8217;m getting too used to beautiful printed text (not designed or artful, but simply beautiful, well done, and functional), I think, and now the web seems stagnant and awful. But I know a copy of Flash can produce all kinds of evils if used for whole sites, so I sit here and get gradually more and more frustrated. At the end of the day, I couldn&#8217;t manage static graphics for text, either. This blog has over 1,000 posts with over 2,000 comments and over a quarter million words associated with the posts alone, and I&#8217;m both a little scared (amount of my life lost) and proud (amount of personal vocabulary and expression development) of that. Too much to be manually managed, that&#8217;s for sure. Which means something but I&#8217;m not sure exactly what. Or, rather, I could posit many things but will elect not to in the interest of brevity. Because I&#8217;m so good at that \*rolls eyes\*
