I gotta say, I really don&#8217;t get those places. I wound up on the [@Newtown][1] website this evening (it&#8217;s part of Petersham RSL club, as the website says &#8212; I still live in the East, just in case anyone was wondering) and was utterly perplexed. Not just because they&#8217;ve created an image-sliced site using Fireworks + Dreamweaver 2004 in 2006, but more because of the content.

> &#8220;Come and enjoy the *indulgent* surroundings of Sydney&#8217;s **hottest RSL club** with **2** levels of exciting *live entertainment*, cocktail lounge, restaurant and pool tables, you won&#8217;t want to *leave*. Enjoy *comfort* and *sophistication* like no other venue in Sydney. **Now open** til **late**&#8220;

it proudly gushes on the front page, images of clean, spacious bars and young, attractive patrons (mostly female) flashing above the promoter&#8217;s rhetoric. Down the bottom, a &#8220;Powered by Moshtix&#8221; logo adorns the footer. Buried somewhere beneath all this is the obligatory required-by-legislation-but-of-uncertain-meaning-to-anyone &#8220;Information for members & their guests&#8221; byline.

Has anyone ever actually gone to an RSL as a guest? And what does it mean to be an RSL guest? RSL, of course, stands for &#8220;Returned services league&#8221;. In practice this seems to mean pretty much anyone who could be stuffed to join their cause. There&#8217;s all kinds of quirky stuff on the [RSL website][2] about their aims and goals and whatever, but I&#8217;ll leave you to read that for yourself. My slightly-right-of-centre readers might be upset if I started quoting bits from it selectively with the goal of ridiculing the organisation further than this post already does.

Anyway, at any rate, it seems self-evident that RSL clubs seem to have little connection to returned servicemen (and/or women) at all.
