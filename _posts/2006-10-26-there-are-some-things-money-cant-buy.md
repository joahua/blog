(in Australia). For everything else, there&#8217;s eBay and Amazon.

My money doesn&#8217;t go anywhere near as far on textbooks here as it would if we were fortunate enough to have books at the same price they are in the US. I&#8217;m trying to track down some Vygotsky works (and Fisher&#8217;s collection is categorised by emptiness, haven&#8217;t checked out UNSW yet but imagine it wouldn&#8217;t be much/any better) and don&#8217;t want to spend the earth to pursue what is, essentially, an entirely peripheral interest. So I can spend, you know, $190 on a decent text in Australia, or I can get that bundled with one other (also apparently excellent resource) for US$50 plus shipping from Amazon. It&#8217;s absolutely nuts.

One day someone will try to explain the economics behind this to me. And that day my head will implode with frustration.
