I think in blog posts whenever I feel compelled to write. I try to start with a title but if it doesn&#8217;t come I don&#8217;t fuss too much, even though the creative beauty of a concise title is often superior to much of what I churn out. Then an opening sentence has probably formed in my mind even as I come up with the title (or, if I don&#8217;t have a title, I have a sentence waiting in its place that&#8217;s great but too long/inappropriate as a title for other reasons) and it spills out of my fingers. It isn&#8217;t always miraculous but feels, to me, meaningful or pithy and catchy or gratuitously clever (or even regularly clever without puns that make you want to spew) &#8212; rarely is a title purely descriptive.

The sentence shapes the first paragraph, which tends to go on until I run out of linking sentences, at which point I begin a new one. Or, sometimes, ideas will be separated into paragraphs (as anyone who tells people how to write will advise). Sometimes (other some-times, for there are many) I&#8217;m spilling words onto a page and don&#8217;t want to break the line in case it stops. That&#8217;s why poetry feels pretentious: the idea that ideas will readily transcend lines is steeped in artifice. I can&#8217;t look back a sentence or it all fades away and momentum is lost forever. The present sentence is all that can be re-read (perhaps that explains my long sentences?) and even that&#8230; well, sometimes extensive punctuation (my overused parentheses bow politely) demarcs boundaries not to ever be transgressed.

But then I felt like writing and the idea faded, or was fulfilled, and the want to share faded to invisibility. As did the inertia of words, it all rolled to a stop. Tiredness met experience and writing, all of a sudden, was not the same as remembering, living. And whilst text can creatively extend so many things, sometimes it isn&#8217;t a matter of extension or sharing at all. Some things, no matter how they are thought, are not for writing, blogging, publishing, and never will be.
