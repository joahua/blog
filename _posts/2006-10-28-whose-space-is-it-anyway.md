I&#8217;ve never been so stubbornly opposed by a website. This is actually so painful that if it weren&#8217;t necessary to somehow observe people using MySpace I would have given up well and truly by now. I actually can&#8217;t use this. I am sitting here scratching my head trying to figure out how to add a photo via the embedded photo upload thing to my profile. What *is* this? I&#8217;m so sure I&#8217;m not the only one that gets royally pissed off at this thing. Why?
