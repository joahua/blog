Snazzy. And enormous. 1700 &#215; 700 &#215; some height but who really cares so long as there&#8217;s legroom enough?

It gives me a sense of consumeristic pleasure ($175 and it&#8217;s not cheap & nasty flatpack&#8230; it&#8217;s slightly better-than-IKEA-quality flatpack ;-)) and makes the room seems loads bigger and&#8230; will not help me pass my exams in the least. Nor will it sort out my subject selection for next year.

Take victories where you can find them, I suppose.
