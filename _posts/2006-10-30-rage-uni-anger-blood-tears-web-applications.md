I am about to start crying because of a web application for the second time in (I think) as many days. No, it&#8217;s not MySpace (it was sufficiently vanquished after some tumbling about with pointed sticks).

I suppose I should have known better. Just because there&#8217;s no warning, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not about to do something stupid. Particularly given the University of Sydney&#8217;s web team&#8217;s fetish for session timeouts like they&#8217;re running some high-grade-cipher-required (they use 256bit SSL certs for everything) nuclear launch system. Only not, because Kim isn&#8217;t a student. But, then again, even if he were the usability issues would probably be manifestly more successful than the UN/non-proliferation treaties.

Whatever. So I spent too long agonising (and I do mean agonising) over subject selection for pre-enrolment (I know, I don&#8217;t need to worry, I can change it later &#8212; whatever. I&#8217;m having a stressful day and for whatever reason am choosing to get this out of the way now so that I don&#8217;t experience this later. That&#8217;s the theory.) and then the monster ate it all. What really [expletive] me is that when I finally made my last choice, I went and entered it then its bloody popup-confirmation system (which, incidentally, is quite usable but I despise it on principle) *still worked*. Submit it? Sorry, you&#8217;re not logged in. Log in? Their [another expletive] auth proxy doesn&#8217;t even pass the right GET vars (strips ? and possibly ampersands, too, it seems, so I got a lovely 404 page), let alone everything I just POST&#8217;d. Talk about stabbing users in the back.

Words cannot express how irate I am right now.

To top it off, I&#8217;m increasingly convinced I somehow managed to screw up my whole degree programme whilst still in first year Arts. No, I didn&#8217;t think that were possible, either. I am adequately pissed off with the world to leave this post here.
