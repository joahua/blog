<p>It&#8217;s based in Sydney and transmits to my house (it&#8217;s got coverage equal to all commercial licenses in Sydney) and I still listen to it online.</p>

<p>Mostly because I haven&#8217;t got a radio here. Also because it doesn&#8217;t count towards quota (Bigpond Unmetered, baby. It&#8217;s the thing I&#8217;m going to miss most about this when the contract expires in January.) And also because the music is actually a lot of fun. Great quality programming which is really surprising (and I remember listening to it just after it first got its permanent license&#8230; things have improved lots!)</p>
<p>Kick on with a Windows Media stream at <a href="mms://wmt.streaming.telstra.com/UCS-wh_telstr16livefbi">mms://wmt.streaming.telstra.com/UCS-wh_telstr16livefbi</a> or if you&#8217;re not into that whole bandwidth-draining thing and wanna be old school, flick your radio&#8217;s dial around to FM 94.5. Not guaranteed to please, but generally quite closer to the listenable side than commercial radio ever was.</p>
