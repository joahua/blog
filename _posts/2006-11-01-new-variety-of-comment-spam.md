&#8220;thanks for the review of liferea, very interesting&#8221; from fanof don lapre arrived in my moderation queue today. I approved it. I think automated services (Akismet) probably would have, too. Fanof looked like a possible first name at a glance (obviously, it&#8217;s not &#8212; it means &#8220;Fan of&#8221; and Don Lapre is a name) but the commenter URL linked to an innocuous website with pay-for-copy content and occasional spam links.

So where&#8217;d the authentic-looking comment come from? (It was on my Liferea review post.) I&#8217;m pretty sure someone must link here using that text. For example, I might say &#8220;check out this (link start) review of Liferea (link end)&#8221; in an article, and spam robots would see that pointed to a blog (perhaps using Technorati or similar) and pursue the link to leave a comment. Using human text. I don&#8217;t know what the linguistic success rate of this would be &#8212; though I would hazard with the amount of blog content out there, one could have fairly stringent filters to improve success &#8212; but it worked well in this instance.
