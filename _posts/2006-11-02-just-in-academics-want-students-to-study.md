ENGL1005 major assessment results aren&#8217;t coming back until after the exam (the exam which, you know, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to even look at yet but probably need to study more than for even very imminent things) because they &#8220;haven&#8217;t been marked&#8221;. I&#8217;m inclined to think that the quality of them sucks, and rather than simply demoralising students, they want everyone to put in a concerted effort for the exam, and then, after briefly gauging the quality of exam responses, they can scale assessment and exam marks as required to ensure everyone passes whilst not actually preventing people from doing work. Sounds dodgy, but would probably make a lot of sense from their perspective.
