Easier to burn out and destroy than with any other audience. No opportunity to rebrand and try again after a year or two &#8212; we&#8217;ve got them for six. And stale data (users) is stigmatic. Necessary? The climate (SocNet&#8217;ing mÃªlÃ©e) is hopefully not the catalyst, even if overally adoption is up. Survey time, methinks&#8230; scary. We live in a world of prophecy and, inevitably, most are wrong. Welcome to the web.
