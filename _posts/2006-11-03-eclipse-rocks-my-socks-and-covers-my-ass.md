I just had my butt saved massively by Eclipse.

I&#8217;m not even using it with SVN/CVS but local versioning fixed an accidental overwrite. Best. App. Ever. It just secured its place as my markup development tool of choice. I used to be ambivalent about it where there wasn&#8217;t any PHP (using the excellent PHP Eclipse plugin) involved, because of lack of syntax highlighting and whatever else (this can be remedied very quickly using the [Eclipse Web Standard Tools (WST) subproject][1], but it isn&#8217;t installed by default), but for everything else it offers, and for the inevitable transition into a programming language once projects reach a certain stage, it&#8217;s so worth using earlier in the process anyway.
