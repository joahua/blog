Perhaps just to prove my capacity for strenuous research (and procrastination), I compiled a tracklisting by ear of the absolute all-time classic mix CD, Nyah, which I located today when searching for a power brick completely by accident.

1.  Ameno &#8211; Era
2.  The Energy &#8211; Audiovent
3.  The World I Know &#8211; Collective Soul
4.  Outside of Me &#8211; Killing Heidi
5.  One Last Breath &#8211; Creed
6.  No Such Thing &#8211; John Mayer
7.  Wonderful &#8211; Everclear
8.  All Star &#8211; Smashmouth
9.  Everything &#8211; M2M
10. I&#8217;m Too Sexy &#8211; MC Hammer
11. Clubbed to Death (Kurayamino Mix) &#8211; Rob D
12. Outside &#8211; Staind
13. Stop Crying Your Heart Out &#8211; Oasis
14. Disease &#8211; Matchbox 20
15. Underneath It All &#8211; No Doubt
16. 2&#8242;s Company &#8211; Charlton Hill
17. Sk8er Boi &#8211; Avril. (Of course!)
18. I Can&#8217;t Wait &#8211; Hilary Duff
19. Like a Prayer &#8211; Rufio

Ameno, the Like a Prayer cover, and Charlton Hill posed the most difficulties. But discovering the CD in a declining state, the power of such preservation efforts in the interest of nostalgia are well worth it.

Good. Times.

Digital restoration and redistribution required, methinks ;-) It&#8217;s funny because a lot of the tracks I heard and thought I&#8217;d done something bad to my headphones, then realised that&#8217;s just what highly compressed tracks off Napster sounded like back in the day. It&#8217;s been a while&#8230;
