I want to buy a CD right now. I&#8217;ve heard an artist I love, I want to hear more of it, and I can&#8217;t buy it online. Well, I possibly could (though as an artist on an Australian indie label they&#8217;re probably not exactly available through [URGE][1] or [iTMS][2]) but certainly not in any instantly-gratifiable way. Which is really the rub, isn&#8217;t it?

If I bought DRM&#8217;d music, I could have it now. If I wait a few days, I can have it DRM free. This applies as much to obscure artists on indie labels as it does to top 40 hits: even so-called &#8216;enhanced&#8217; CDs are close enough to [Red Book][3] spec that you can rip the guts out of them to beautiful lossless FLAC files without much difficulty.

That&#8217;s what&#8217;s so bloody illogical about this whole conundrum: I can still get content in better-than-iTunes quality without DRM. I just can&#8217;t have it now.

Why not just let me have it now as an MP3 (OGG or FLAC would be nicer, but I&#8217;d settle for less ;-)) whilst I wait for the CD to arrive? What about this model *doesn&#8217;t* make sense? I would buy so much more music if licensers played to my at-computer (or, in this case, in-room at-radio) impulse buying tendencies. I doubt they&#8217;re ever going to get it.
