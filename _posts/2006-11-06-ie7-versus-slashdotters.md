So [it&#8217;s been delayed in Japan][1] because of unspecified issues (probably to do with localisation) and Slashdot comments are an absolute moron-fest. There are way too many people in there caught completely by surprise by this thing, including one who ironically says &#8220;Thanks Redmond&#8221; after IE7 broke their business&#8217; online payment system.

Why not just wear a t-shirt saying &#8220;I&#8217;m an ignoramus&#8221;?

Clearly, your business depends on it, clearly, it&#8217;s coming soon, clearly&#8230; you did nothing. Oh, yeah, that&#8217;s Redmond&#8217;s fault.

I&#8217;m really appreciating a lot that Microsoft are doing of late, so, without wanting to sound like too much of a fanboy, let me just remark that this person had it coming and any issues faced are entirely their own problem and responsibility. Moron.
