<p>They&#8217;re trying to raise a bit over half a million dollars from listener (member) contributions. It&#8217;s probably not the way I&#8217;d do things but then&#8230; well, I&#8217;m trying to get money for web properties instead, and don&#8217;t have a reach of 200,000 people a week like they do (yet :-)). Their other fundraising models (fee-for-promo) are great &#8212; though probably very common in commercial radio, only FBi are open about it and have to count it as part of their four-minutes-per-hour commercial content under their broadcast license &#8212; and I&#8217;ve appropriated it for use in other contexts&#8230; funny how MSM and Internet media can overlap.</p>
