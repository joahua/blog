It has this way of forgetting stupid mistakes that indexed, online things cannot. Or, can, but do not. Or something. You can&#8217;t convincingly scrunch up and get rid of a file, but things that make you cringe on a piece of dead tree are far more readily disposed of. Electronically, there&#8217;s always this sense of &#8220;what if getting rid of this breaks something else that refers to it?&#8221; &#8212; paper has no concrete chronology, which is wonderful. I never understood people dating their letters, unless they fully anticipate getting the letters of [name] published and/or are trying to pretend that something only arrived late because of the postal service. We place far too much emphasis on intervals at times.
