Appears to work by dragging down everything a great deal. I presume this is to prevent anything clipping (down is better than up, use system wave and master faders to make it loud again if you must) but don&#8217;t really understand how it gauged the best performance point: it levelled volume way too quickly to have indexed levels in the entire library. Maybe it&#8217;s a progressive thing, or maybe the data was kept even before the feature was enabled (if, in fact, that is the way this is being performed).

I would be interested to know, because regardless as to how it works exactly, their levelling kind of sucks. I&#8217;ll admit I haven&#8217;t used a library programme to manage my music for a while, but seem to recall things on Linux being that much more consistent. That was before I tottered off to CD land several months back (long story, involving a missing road case and a messy office&#8230; things still aren&#8217;t quite back to normal, that&#8217;s one of my summer projects), where you&#8217;re expected to flip the volume control backwards and forwards with alarming regularity. I don&#8217;t know if this problem would be any less prevalent if I didn&#8217;t have such a smattered collection of tracks from different genres&#8230; one would think that, in the same way all pop is mixed to sound identical, surely it would be mastered in a similarly stereotypical fashion. Or perhaps not.
