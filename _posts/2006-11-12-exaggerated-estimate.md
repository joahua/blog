From Apple&#8217;s [Quicktime Pro][1] webpage:

> Professional studios around the world spend millions of dollars and man-hours producing commercial entertainment. Please don&#8217;t steal their work or in ten years, it will cost $50(2) to see a movie in the theater [sic]. But, you can find lots of material on the Web that&#8217;s legal to cut, copy and remix. Look for the Creative Commons license and add to the worldâ€™s culture.

What. The.

It&#8217;s hard to tell whether they&#8217;re mocking the MPAA&#8217;s of the world or being serious. In which case, it&#8217;s great to see they&#8217;re being honest, but, again&#8230; what the?

Oh, and I still haven&#8217;t bought Quicktime Pro. I went there via their [trailers][2] site and saw this line in the footer: &#8220;Broken Movie icons? QuickTime 7 is now required to view Trailers- and it&#8217;s free.&#8221;

Clearly, Quicktime 7 isn&#8217;t free if you paid for 6. And, so far as I know, there&#8217;s no way to run multiple versions of Quicktime in tandem. So if you want to be able to view new generation content being created, you&#8217;re basically locked into a continual upgrade cycle. Which is a load of crap.

Also a load of crap is their Australian pricing for Quicktime Pro, which is $AU44 versus $US29 (about $AU38 at time of writing). The bits are identical. Don&#8217;t charge me more. I have foreign exchange transaction fees added to my card if I purchase something in a different currency, but it&#8217;s not anything near six dollars (try twenty cents or something ridiculously small). And it doesn&#8217;t cost you six dollars more to send an email to Australia instead of to your US customers.

I&#8217;m in this bizarre pseudo-closed-source land at the minute and I&#8217;m really fearful for the longevity of content sitting where I am now. In terms of relative openness, Apple aren&#8217;t looking too crash hot right at the minute&#8230;
