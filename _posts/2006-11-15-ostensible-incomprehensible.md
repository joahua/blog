I have *got* to get a better domain name. Some poor guy just tried to send a quote to my email address @goah.com

This domain is definitely not designed for telephone communication.

Any ideas for another one (I&#8217;m not relinquishing this one yet) with greater respect for the phonetic sensibilities of our language? Various combinations of josh/joshua street/st are available at both gTLD and ccTLD levels, but they bore me somewhat. Open to all ideas, accepting of them only at my discretion. ;-)
