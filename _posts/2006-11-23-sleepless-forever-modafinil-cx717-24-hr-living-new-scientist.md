[Get ready for 24-hour living &#8211; New Scientist][1]

Thinking *Brave New World* and being reminded of *Abbreviated Human*, especially by this quote at the end:

> Stanley believes that drugs like modafinil and CX717 will tempt people to overdose on wakefulness at the expense of sleep. &#8220;Being awake is seen to be attractive,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s not cool to be asleep.&#8221; Foster has similar worries. &#8220;It seems like that technology will help us cope with 24/7, but is coping really living?&#8221; he asks.

It&#8217;s almost cheesy (as was AH), but interesting to observe.
