It was a great success on Friday night, praise God. We had a couple of kids who don&#8217;t usually come to TACKLES come along, and they all loved it &#8230; and *we* (the leaders, that is) all loved it! Haha. I&#8217;ve got a couple of photos but won&#8217;t post them here&#8230; sigh. Pretty sure we&#8217;re cleared to use them but&#8230; whatever.

Anyway, here&#8217;s a massive (it&#8217;s like 3x2m/10&#215;6.5&#8242;) painting they all did over the course of the evening:

![1 Peter 2:11 - Dear friends, I urge you as aliens and strangers in the world to abstain from sinful desires which war against your soul][1]

Awesome, huh?
