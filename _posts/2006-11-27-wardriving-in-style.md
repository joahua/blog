![Wardriving in style: a car with a huge antenna on it and a sign.][1]

Spotted this thing cruisin&#8217; through the streets of Newtown a week or so back. I want one. For those who can&#8217;t see great, it&#8217;s a vehicle with two big mumma antennas hooked up to a guy with a laptop sitting inside (yes, hooked up to the guy, the laptop is just so he can play CS&#8230; what do you think I meant?), whilst the sign on the back reads &#8220;CAUTION: Slow moving vehicle, Radio coverage testing&#8221;.

In other words, All Your WEP/WPA Are Belong To Us. Classy.

<ins>Later: When writing this post I spelt &#8220;Antenna&#8221; as &#8220;Umbrella&#8221;. Apologies for any other gaping mistakes &#8212; clearly, I&#8217;m not quite with it.</ins>
