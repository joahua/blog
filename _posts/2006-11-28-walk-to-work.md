Just for kicks I decided to walk in to work today (my weekly bus ticket ran out and that&#8217;s as good an excuse as any). Took me pretty much dead on an hour to get here, which is quite a decent time spent in transit. I&#8217;d be half an hour to 40 minutes were I to catch a bus (once you count waiting time, etc.) so it&#8217;s really not that bad at all. Might try and make this a regular occurrence.
