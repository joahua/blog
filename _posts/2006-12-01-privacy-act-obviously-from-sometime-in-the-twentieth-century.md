This thing is so obviously not written (yes, or amended) with websites in mind. If you&#8217;re not a financial institution or dealing with medical records, there&#8217;s really not that much there for you. Sigh. On the plus side, there really isn&#8217;t that much there for you. Privacy, it seems, is a murky battlefield between apparently redundant legislation and media-fuelled community expectations.

Having said that, the [National Privacy Hotline][1] (1300 363 992) is ridiculously helpful, albeit (necessarily) cautious in the words of advice that its representatives give! Definitely worth a call if you&#8217;re struggling to find something on their website and just want clarification.
