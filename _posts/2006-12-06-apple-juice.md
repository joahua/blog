Spent most of this afternoon absolutely raging at an iMac. They&#8217;re unstable, buggy, pieces of crap and any pretense at simplicity is entirely unfounded. Several behaviours (or lack thereof) are altogether ridiculous &#8212; even Windows manages to do photo thumbnailing & previews better, and, yes, it&#8217;s a PC. Take that and shove it up your &#8220;I&#8217;m a Mac, I&#8217;m a PC&#8221; commercials &#8212; I *can&#8217;t* use Excel, but I can sure as anything see what photos I have on a CD when I throw them in my drive. Sigh.

I was lead to believe that iMovie was a safer bet than Windows anything-free, but after this afternoon&#8217;s experience, perhaps not. Time to blow $800 on Adobe Production Studio already, methinks. This end of the year makes me feel like applying for a credit card (for practical reasons, not just &#8220;silly-season&#8221; consumerism), but I won&#8217;t, yet.

Also had fun this morning sending a hundred and fifty dollars (or thereabouts) worth of lamps up in flames. Well, not quite anything so spectacular, but they&#8217;re dead now. Even so, still vaguely ahead of the game. If anyone wants to buy a stack of 110V 1,000W GE Par 64 globes&#8230; heh. I have a feeling this investment may prove profitable sometime in the next decade when there is finally spare time enough! Meh! Either way, this morning was good times. And Katy & myself now feel rather more pleased with our ghetto grey-area-legality electrician skillz, knowing that it was the lamps, not our wiring, which sucked. Or, didn&#8217;t suck but were totally not designed for certain usage. Or something.

Mind you, I&#8217;m no particular stranger to blowing theatrical lights. At ANCON, out of a rig of perhaps twenty par 64&#8242;s, three broke on my watch (two on the last day). I&#8217;m adamant it&#8217;s because the venue&#8217;s power sucked, but the site manager reckoned they hadn&#8217;t needed replacement in over two years. Which makes me think that, given a 2000 hour rating on such things which gives &lt;170 days @ 12 hours a day, they can&#8217;t have been using the space too much! Shrug.

I should probably just leave the lights alone for a couple of months so that I spend enough time working to afford video things &#8212; which would, recursively, cause the same problem as the lights, I spose! All good fun.
