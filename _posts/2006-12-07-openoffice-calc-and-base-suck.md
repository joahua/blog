I recognise this post is highly ironic in light of yesterday&#8217;s remarks about [my not being able to use a spreadsheet][1] in parody of Apple&#8217;s Mac/PC ads, but, please, let it slide.

So all I want is an `enum` field. Or a multiple choice box, easy to get in Excel.

Neither of these are available at time of writing. The term &#8220;enum&#8221; has only been mentioned on any OO.o mailing lists pertaining to Base nine times, ever. And it supposedly connects to a MySQL server. Yeah, right.

I guess it&#8217;s back to rapid prototyping of a web interface to deal with data entry, or using Excel/Access&#8230; sigh. This was meant to be the quick and easy (and open source) solution.
