I don&#8217;t usually even remember dreams. And, when I do, they&#8217;re generally just random narratives that don&#8217;t link in closely with real life. Last night was different&#8230; I dreamt that a box of computer stuff arrived unexpectedly (from a known sender, with known contents&#8230; it just wasn&#8217;t meant to be sent for free/at all), and then, in some bizarre shift that tends to happen in dreams, I was at church before something started (Carols service? evidently the holiday I&#8217;m meant to be away on then didn&#8217;t happen&#8230; but what happens next defies that chronology) just standing near the door, when all of a sudden a friend who is a long way away taps me on the shoulder & we go and sit down somewhere. Just for a day, just on a stopover at home, before heading elsewhere&#8230; but still&#8230; lovely. <small>I miss more than I think</small>. Then there were vision and sound problems, but I wasn&#8217;t going to get up in case my friend disappeared. And the problems fixed themselves/other people appeared (literally, it&#8217;s a dream okay?) to fix them.

But this morning is weird because the dream established a contrast of distance from reality that isn&#8217;t entirely pleasant. That&#8217;s why good (completely) irrational dreams must be better than good (tenuously) bound-to-reality dreams. And now I&#8217;m in that post-dream woke-up-too-early (I woke up normally) state of confusion & expecting something strange to happen & not knowing exactly what&#8217;s going on or if everything is alright (there were other dreams, too). By the time that feeling subsides, I will have forgotten the dreams completely and remember them only by this milestone. This boundary stone of dreams.
