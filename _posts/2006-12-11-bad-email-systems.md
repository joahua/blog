E-mail should just work.

I resent badly setup/maintained/functioning e-mail systems probably more than any other web deficiency. I get immensely frustrated when trying to work through a slow web proxy, but that is nothing compared to the wrath that an e-mail running several hours late (or, you know, simply being dropped and not arriving at all) brings forth in me.

An IT department shall fear me tomorrow. (I say that in a loving way, of course&#8230;)
