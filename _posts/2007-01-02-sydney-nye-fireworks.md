Taken from [Ellen][17]&#8216;s house (thanks Ellen :D) Just for kicks, see if you can compare the first shot in this post (5 minutes before any fireworks) to a similarly composed photo later on, paying special attention to the amount of clouds visible. Somehow I don&#8217;t reckon they&#8217;re buying carbon credits for this $AU4M detonation.

The fireworks themselves were crap&#8230; we were all left wondering if something else was going to happen (that being the symbolism of the question mark?) &#8230; but then perhaps the question mark was meant to be something else. I was waiting for it to flash up the letters &#8220;LOLHAX&#8221; in succession. That would have made me giggle so much I would have fallen off the pier, but not before snapping plenty of photos of it ;-)

So, who&#8217;s up for bridge-hacking/culture-jamming to an audience of a quarter of Sydney&#8217;s population next year?
