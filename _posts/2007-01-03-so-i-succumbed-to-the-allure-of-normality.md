That is, an interesting way of saying &#8220;I have a new phone that doesn&#8217;t require a concerted weights training regime for several months before you can begin carrying it around with you&#8221;.

Nothing amazing, it&#8217;s a fairly average looking Sony Ericsson V630i. My rationale in buying it was that it&#8217;s not as though it&#8217;s part of the same business units as the DRM morons, anyway, and actively subverts their cause by offering MP3 & WMA support, instead of retarded ATRAC specialness. It does use an M2 card instead of microSD, though, which is a bit of a shame.

Its PC Syncing is adequate, though obviously not up to the Windows Mobile perfection to which I am accustomed :P

Mostly I just wanted PC syncing to make contact transfer painless. The &#8220;PDA&#8221; functionality (if one even dare call it that) is very much a secondary thing: I&#8217;m vaguely considering buying a Palm, but not until I&#8217;ve got my head around this completely. It&#8217;s rather on the usable side, but the interface is obviously more limited than a touch screen would ever be.

It cost me&#8230; nothing, on a Vodafone contract. I didn&#8217;t mind that because I&#8217;m not locked into the handset for the contract length &#8212; I can unlock it from the Vodafone network today if I want, without any charge, and stick my (3G, but, alas, I&#8217;ve only got partial 3G coverage at my house &#8212; with both 3 and Vodafone/Optus, haven&#8217;t tested Telstra &#8212; so there&#8217;s not a great deal of UTMS going down here at the minute &#8212; regular triband GSM wins out) SIM into any other phone.

Yes, that&#8217;s right, petty 3 users. I can change phones without having to go grovelling to my network provider. Howdyalikethathuh? \*gloats\* :)

Anyway. It&#8217;s still good fun. It also has an MP3 player, but the probably-prohibitive cost of M2 media for this thing, combined with the supremely uncomfortable bundled headphones (they&#8217;re designed for like, elephants or something) and lack of regular 3.5mm jack (\*tear\*) mean it&#8217;s not likely to get used much. &#8216;cept to say it supports WMA & MP3 ringtones, which is about as much fun as I had with the iPaq, only Windows Media Player actually supports this as a media device.

Yes, friends, that too is irony.
