I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve been missing out on this for so long. It&#8217;s useful for so much more than handsfree headsets and brain-killing wireless headphones!

My phone has a presenter mode when paired with a PC (and, yes, it can be used as a mouse as well&#8230; but I&#8217;d never do that :P) and works at a range of at least five meters (which was kind of as far as I could walk whilst still seeing a screen in this place). You&#8217;d pay $90 for that kinda gadget on its own!

The only problem I&#8217;ve got with it is the lack of a presenter timer built in &#8212; if it had that, it&#8217;d be perfect. Guess that&#8217;s what you pay the $90 for these days :P

If I ever said anything bad about Bluetooth just being a gimmick, consider it sufficiently retracted.
