Comments, that is. If you posted a comment in the last week and it wasn&#8217;t automatically approved, I&#8217;m zapping it now. I need to get Akismet setup, which depresses me something horrid. Internetz sucks.

If your comments don&#8217;t usually auto moderate (typically because you don&#8217;t provide the same name & email address as on a comment you&#8217;ve posted in the past that I&#8217;d let through) then probably don&#8217;t bother commenting until I say it&#8217;s safe to do so, coz it&#8217;s only gonna get zapped.
