Okay, hopefully commenting is going to work right about now. I just upgraded to the latest WordPress (2.0.6 at time of writing, with 2.1 due out in a week&#8217;s time) which is long, long overdue &#8212; I was running a 1.5 series release with known security holes for more than six months after they were announced &#8212; but whatever. It seems to be working now, and I&#8217;m using WordPress 2.0 in more places these days, so it seems only sensible to give it a whirl and see.

If you&#8217;re experiencing difficulties try and drop me an e-mail, or something :-)
