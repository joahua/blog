Some bits of wisdom, mostly from Nathan Sandon, who was speaking at the Senior High (11-12) programme at Summer School &#8217;07 this last week (I was leading, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t comment!):

Christian life is:

*   Dropping beers to your mates
*   Sleeping further from the door
*   Squawking less
*   Flying more
*   Going to the ends of the earth in concentric circles
*   Trusting a trustworthy God
*   Picking up a Bible and trusting & learning from that firstmost & before what mere men have to say in churches, youth groups, bible studies, etc.
*   Recognising that if Christians need grace & a relationship with God through Christ for life, why would anyone else *not* need to hear that?
*   Using everything for Him. What are we holding back?
