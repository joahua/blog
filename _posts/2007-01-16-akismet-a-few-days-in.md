It is like rain after many hours of stifling humidity: it is like falling onto bed and being asleep in moments, pausing only to realise the satisfaction of being still after a long day.

I can check my email again and be excited to see a new message, because chances are it&#8217;s from a real person. (Comment notifications are now worth having turned on and generally sensible). At first it was simply too strange to comprehend, but now I am revelling in the brilliant relief it provides. Perhaps, now, using web publishing software will be enjoyable again.

I&#8217;ve been thinking a fair bit of late about the psychology of brand control (be that personal or corporate branding), perplexed from a few months back when bands first started putting their myspace URL next to (or in place of) their expensive-developed-by-Sony/BMG/Universal/&#8230;-records-Flash-powered-yuppie website. In doing so I nearly went (nearly being quite a few times), &#8220;you know, the LiveJournal crew never experience the kind of crap I&#8217;m putting up with&#8221; and switched. Of course, WordPress.com users exist behind a magical wall, too, but that&#8217;s beside the point &#8212; If I was going to switch, it would be (at least in part) for social reasons, and there&#8217;s no-one cool using WordPress.com. (&#8220;Cool&#8221; is in the eye of the beholder &#8212; for me, Robert Scoble is not cool, or, at very least, not someone to be emulated)  
So, anyway, I&#8217;m not spending an hour a day moderating comments. That figure is truly obscene given that on an average week I might only get ten to fifteen genuine comments, if that. A lot for very little in return. I nearly switched off the comments altogether a couple of times, but I&#8217;m too much of an egocentric prick to deal with that very well. So now things are better.

I&#8217;m now free to do more of&#8230; something. I&#8217;ll probably find out exactly what that is about the same time as everyone else. Besides, all the cool kids use Myspace or Facebook nowadays, anyway, so the audience isn&#8217;t a big deal much &#8212; only Facebook is smart enough to import my RSS feed as &#8220;Notes&#8221;, whilst Myspace is still gushing generic ColdFusion error pages. It is the biggest piece of crap hackjob high profile website I&#8217;ve ever seen. It&#8217;s a good thing their only revenue comes from advertising partners whose ads are hosted on other servers, otherwise I would so be expecting a massively expensive class action lawsuit when they get their crappy website pwned by some script kiddie who&#8217;s messing around with a spot of SQL injection for the first time.

Not that I&#8217;m even a programmer. But I nearly found one today. Please be praying that I get geeks better than the ones at Myspace for the current thing that&#8217;s quietly baking away. I&#8217;m hoping to present it to nearly a thousand people over the next two weeks and haul in some unemployed/looking-for-more-exciting-work programmers in that process.

Random observation &#8212; It&#8217;s funny how I talk about that project on here with a completely different voice to the one I use on the other blog. I haven&#8217;t got any issues with complete strangers reading what I write here, so long as it&#8217;s taken in context (i.e. I&#8217;ve ranted about spam before, I&#8217;ve ranted about cool/uncool SocNets before, I&#8217;ve ranted about how horrible I find Myspace from a usability/technical perspective before, so my holding them up as Thebes to my Athens is entirely acceptable). The problem with writing for a blog read *once off* by complete strangers is that every article has to stand alone. It actually ceases to fit within the &#8220;blog&#8221; genre, because chronology is pretty much left for dead. Which is kind of a shame, but whatever.

In summary: Akismet saves sanity. Losing control is sometimes a good thing. Myspace is horrible. Josh/CYIADA nearly might possibly maybe have a programmer so please pray for &#8220;us&#8221;. Myspace is horrible. Corporate/project blogging necessarily takes a different form (mode, style, whatever) to individual blogging. Myspace is horrible.
