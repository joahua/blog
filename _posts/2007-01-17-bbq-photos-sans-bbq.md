Just a couple of photos from a BBQ at Tim&#8217;s house last night. There was a certain piratical flavour to photography that evening, methinks &#8212; observe my pointy implement wielding skills and Selo&#8217;s facial expressions x2. Vet gets award for poser of the evening, though at least one of those was completely unintentional on her part.  
As is usual in these parts, more in the [Flickr photo set][1] (unedited).
