I was amused to notice the new dashboard in WordPress when I updated to 2.0.6 the other day (earlier 2.0.x releases were different). They&#8217;ve ditched the &#8220;Other WordPress News&#8221; section, generally filled with rather irrelevant crap that takes a decent spot of time for servers all over the planet to download sources of and display.
