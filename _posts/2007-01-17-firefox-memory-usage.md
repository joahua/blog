I love how Firefox can just sit there, chillin&#8217; on a quarter of a GB of memory, even in version 2.

OpenOffice doesn&#8217;t use that much memory. The GIMP&#8217;s been a running and used process nearly as long and it&#8217;s still using less than 200MB of memory.

Where, o Firefox, is *your* clone tool for designing from various &#8216;inspirations&#8217; online, hey?

Small consolation is that it crashed and didn&#8217;t close properly (hence my thinking to check how much memory the monster was using&#8230; 2GB is generally pretty roomy for me, so I&#8217;m not too stressed about resources), so obviously everything *is not okay* and they&#8217;ve got some work to do for the next release still.

Or I&#8217;ll go back to using Opera, I tells ya!

(Slightly tongue in cheek &#8212; I can&#8217;t go back to Opera, on account of having discovered the wondrous tool that is Firebug. Sigh. Damn extensions. They don&#8217;t even use much memory.)
