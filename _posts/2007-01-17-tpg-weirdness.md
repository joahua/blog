So it&#8217;s fast. But it&#8217;s not so fast during the day. And not so fast when dealing with Australian servers. By way of example, when dealing with AARNet&#8217;s server, I was getting a measly 30KB/s download. So I go and start grabbing the same file off a US server and all of a sudden I&#8217;m cruising along at 500KB/s. Yeah, go figure.

Me, I blame the crappy web proxy they make everyone use. It&#8217;s so cheap, though, that I&#8217;m not too fussed about it.

Just in case you cared, I&#8217;m syncing at 16418/1021&#8230; it&#8217;s acceptably snappy. The performance isn&#8217;t amazing during the day (and you&#8217;ve really got to wonder why&#8211;it&#8217;s not like many businesses use TPG, is it?) but it tends to behave itself more (i.e. with Australian servers) at night. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to hit up a bit of CS/Q3/UT/UT2k4/other network game for &#8220;testing purposes&#8221; yet&#8230; maybe this evening. Maybe.

In other news, I&#8217;ve discovered I&#8217;m generally more productive working from home than in the city. Something to do with a little more sleep, a little less aircon (it&#8217;s oppressively warm compared to super-chilled offices, but I prefer it that way), a little more monitors (I&#8217;ve only got one at work), a little faster Internet (aforementioned speeds versus a 4Mbps link shared between about 150 people, 20+ servers and channelled through a craptacular proxy), and more natural light. Perhaps.

Now the only problem is juggling freelancing commitments with &#8220;employee&#8221; commitments&#8230; but I&#8217;m using a computer for one and textas for the other at the minute, so it&#8217;s fairly clearly delineated right now.

It all drives you slowly crazy, but I was never a huge fan of sanity, anyway.
