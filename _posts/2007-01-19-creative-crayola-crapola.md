I&#8217;m having one of those &#8220;you&#8217;re not in preschool so why does everything you come up with look as though it&#8217;s been designed with extra-large crayons?&#8221; days. Bad times. The stupid thing is I am starting to become really well acquainted with the GIMP&#8217;s capabilities (beyond just making photos look less-bad) and now its interface is what feels limiting (especially the way it handles layers and masks versus the way Photoshop does). So now I&#8217;m up for a grand worth of software (that I *so* can&#8217;t afford) just to make myself feel better about the tools I&#8217;m using, etc. and hopefully get more productive accordingly.  
Anyone wanna donate to the buy-Josh-Creative-Suite-2 (even though 3 is about to come out) fund? It&#8217;s my birthday tomorrow, if that helps! ;-) Hehe. (No, really, it&#8217;s my birthday tomorrow&#8230; I&#8217;m joking about the buying me CS2 bit though)  
Frustratingly, there are free CS3 betas to be had on the Adobe site, but only if you&#8217;re an existing CS2 user. Sigh. I *could* use it at work, but lack of acceptable Internet connectivity and no dual monitors is pushing me to stay at home, instead.

Speaking of software, though, as soon as I buy that it&#8217;s time to finally get Premiere as well. So. Sick. Of. iMovie/WMM/Avid Free DV/whatever. The few times I&#8217;ve had opportunity to use Premiere for a while have been fairly pleasant experiences &#8212; obviously it&#8217;s a lot more powerful than free crap, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to have a massive usability trade-off. Which is, you know, kinda nice. Only, again, kinda expensive.

If I pay any tax this year after having claimed all this software I&#8217;ll be slightly horrified :P
