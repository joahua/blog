Not that I was using it for that, but it&#8217;s really quick and easy file sharing &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t setup port forwarding since we got our new router, so MSN was the way to go for lots of little things&#8230; and today I had to send 750MB of photos to someone and didn&#8217;t have a working server here.

So, just for kicks, we tried via MSN. At this point it&#8217;s also worth remarking that ADSL2+ upload speeds kick butt &#8212; we were done in two hours fifteen apparently (I went AFK but believe MSN&#8217;s logs). And the file even got there intact. I know.  
Not as much bandwidth as the Odyssey (car I drive), but quite enough for when you&#8217;re feeling lazy/out of blank CDs. Double ewe oh oh tee.
