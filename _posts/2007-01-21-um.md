I was just flicking through a video to check it imported into the fairly-horrible thing that is Avid Free DV (most powerful of the freebies but also probably the least reliable) correctly, and there are people saying &#8220;Um&#8221; (one &#8220;er&#8221; just for variety) at every point I randomly clicked to. This scares me somewhat.

And in other news just in, Avid must die. I mentioned it was least reliable&#8211;I actually meant &#8220;most unstable piece of crap&#8221;.
