I&#8217;m just having one of those I-wish-there-were-other-people-on-team days, but bear with me whilst I briefly complain: I&#8217;m sick of having this stupid acronym for a name (CYIADA) &#8212; it&#8217;s as bad as joahua in terms of domain-name spellability! If you&#8217;re ever in doubt about that, apply the radio test: if you had to run a radio ad that had a phone number and web address at the end of it, would it work?

So today we&#8217;re running the second CYIADA presentation and survey up at KYLC (Jodie&#8217;s doing it so I&#8217;m not heading up this week, which is cool but a bit boring! Nearly everyone ran away&#8230;) which got me thinking about it again. Ah well. People will be confused about where it is one more time &#8212; I&#8217;m hoping they&#8217;ll run the web address up on the screens for the duration of a four minute presentation&#8230; that should be long enough to get six letters down!

Anyway&#8230; names&#8230; I&#8217;m so out of ideas. Please be praying for inspiration or someone who&#8217;s got a bit of creative prowess about them to throw at a brand for this thing. (I can do words but marketing and academic writing aren&#8217;t exactly identical&#8230; so I must do at least one of the two badly, I don&#8217;t know which just yet!) Usage: secular evangelism (but it&#8217;s a &#8220;find out more&#8221; resource in that sense, so don&#8217;t avoid using God-words if you were going to &#8212; no-one is being scared off by that), marketing to leaders, marketing to marketers (bands, camps, conferences &#8212; so words in the same semantic realm as &#8220;connect&#8221; are a good idea), and a tiny bit to youth group kids themselves. But if we can hit the first three then the fourth will take care of itself, methinks.
