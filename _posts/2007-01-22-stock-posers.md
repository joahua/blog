I am getting very frustrated at the absolutely disproportionate representation of females over males in low-cost stock photography libraries. Especially in the non-American ones, which, really, is the sensible way to go on account of so much American stock being *so* ridiculously stereotypical and generally clinical. That&#8217;s why so many designers hate Corbis &#8212; it&#8217;s nothing to do with the cost, just the crappy content. Admittedly you don&#8217;t *always* need people-stock, but even so&#8230; when you do&#8230;

If you&#8217;re a girl and know any professional photographers, get your face out of the picture or at the very least, grab a guy and pretend to start talking to him. Okay?

(Yes, tongue in cheek.)
