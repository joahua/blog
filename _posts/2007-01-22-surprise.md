People threw me a surprise party for my birthday.

It took be a full ten seconds after I walked into the room to catch on.

Gem lied to me a lot over the course of several phone calls and conversations, Szanto was complicit in sending faux group text messages (a nice touch), Claudia conspired to offer a venue, and Luke was strategically late. Others probably deserve crediting but will forgive my memory &#8212; perhaps it took me too long to realise and it will come to me in another week or two!  
Was rather good times.

I had to be told to blog this. I&#8217;m not being rude, I just don&#8217;t have any photos of the night to stick up, and, really, it feels a bit flat without them. There was an underwater camera but it ran away to Melbourne before I could steal things from it.

So, maybe photos to come. Marcelo was taking Myspace photos underwater. Addict. Betraying the &#8220;I hate myspace&#8221; cause to which you once held fast! On the plus side, he doesn&#8217;t have the photos yet, either :P
