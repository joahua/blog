Sorry to sound like an absolute fanboy, but I&#8217;ve been hanging out for this for about two weeks (which is a long time for me when it comes to open source software that typically has vague release dates&#8211;although that isn&#8217;t WordPress any more).

Sounds like&#8230; magic to my ears. Also looks as though there may be a bit of work involved when it comes to taking advantage of all the new goodies on old websites, but that&#8217;s probably to be expected. Although it&#8217;s a one-way upgrade (database structure changes), at very least it doesn&#8217;t appear to have *removed* any functionality. Which is beautiful.

I&#8217;m also going to enjoy rolling this out on a multi-user site that&#8217;s using WP as a backend without telling anyone, just to see if they notice the little UI enhancements it&#8217;s throwing out all over the place. (Well, assuming the upgrade goes well&#8230; otherwise I&#8217;ll send a red-faced email letting them know about it!)

I&#8217;ll probably roll it out here before the end of the week. No new theme coming, so it&#8217;s probably only really exciting for me&#8230; but that&#8217;s okay. ;-)
