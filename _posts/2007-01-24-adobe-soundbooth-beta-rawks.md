I downloaded [Adobe Soundbooth Beta][1] earlier this week. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve even tried using audio software, but I&#8217;m making a video and had my heart set on one particular track (The Flashbulb&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic">Passage D</span>&#8230; you&#8217;ve probably heard a remix of it in [Dove&#8217;s Evolution campaign][2]) with a few tweaks to make it actually work well. The visual aspect of this particular 30-second spot is pretty mediocre/low effort, so I figured that, at very least, a decent soundtrack would make it memorable (it only needs to be remembered for a week, too! We&#8217;re running it this Sunday as a reminder that TACKLES is starting up again next week).

This is probably really average stuff these days, but I&#8217;ve never driven Protools and haven&#8217;t touched audio editing things with a barge pole for so many years now that, frankly, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether it&#8217;s objectively innovative or not. Seems brilliant to me.

My biggest problem is that there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any way to add to an existing selection? That, and because I&#8217;ve been spending a bit of time in graphicsland this week (so I&#8217;m a newborn Adobe junkie, oh well!), it seems like the Remove a Sound task (and effects in general) would be a perfect candidate for application of whatever the audio equivalent of a mask layer is in terms of user interface. Non-destructive, easy to turn on/off, easy to build up in multiple passes (because it&#8217;s really still quite linear in the way you have to work).

Then again, it&#8217;s entirely probable I&#8217;ve just completely missed some way of working that makes it all very sensible&#8230; but possibly not. Whatever, I&#8217;m quite content to keep playing for a while longer&#8230; only I&#8217;d like to get this particular job done (audio & video) before today is over!
