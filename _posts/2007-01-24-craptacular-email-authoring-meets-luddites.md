This is [bad news for anyone crafting email campaigns][1], but honestly, if I read one more comment where people plaintively insist that email is only ever meant to be sent as regular text, I just might scream. Go back to breaking textile machines and accepting union-defined minimum wages, seriously. I find it so hard to believe that any of these people are able to hold down serious jobs as sysadmins when they are so completely oblivious to the requirements/desires of the people they&#8217;re employed to provide these services to.

Yes, rich (HTML/RTF/whatever this new crap Outlook 2007 is pulling is) email can be horribly messy. Yes, it is a requirement. Yes, if you think text-only is the way to go, you need to pull your head out of the sand. Welcome to the twenty-first century.

The closest I&#8217;ve come to someone who thought like that was a chap who was adamantly against the idea of content management systems. I jest not, but in my mind that&#8217;s less serious an offense than suggesting that all content on the web should consist solely of text and links, &#8220;because that&#8217;s the way it was designed&#8221;. That is, in essence, what these sysadmins (and some other open-source bigots &#8212; we should all use Mutt and Pine &#8212; who probably haven&#8217;t much experience with the creation or delivery of such things) are arguing.
