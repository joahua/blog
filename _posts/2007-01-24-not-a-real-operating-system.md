I&#8217;ve been running Microsoft&#8217;s [Virtual PC with their IE6 image][1] for the last couple of days (it&#8217;s great &#8212; if you take yourself seriously as a web content producer, it&#8217;s very much a must-have part of the toolkit) and it pulled some funny business on me today.

When they announced it a whole bunch of people were getting a little grumpy about how it didn&#8217;t work with Windows update &#8212; a few of the same were getting grumpy about how Microsoft didn&#8217;t release a version for Linux, but no further comment required on them&#8230; you&#8217;re all of an intelligent enough bunch to realise aforementioned people fall into the category of &#8230; well, you know.

Obviously, it&#8217;s no big deal &#8212; the whole point of that image it is that it *hasn&#8217;t* (and won&#8217;t) update, allowing you to keep testing on older platforms.

But then, this afternoon, I go and shut down the image (I know, suspending is faster, but I was trying something different) and all of a sudden it goes and says it&#8217;s installing 7 updates before it shuts down. In usual XP fashion.

So what gives?

I found myself yelling at it &#8220;you&#8217;re not even a real operating system! Don&#8217;t you get it? You&#8217;re going to be used and trashed in a couple of months anyway! Why do you care if you&#8217;re virus and spyware ridden by the end of it?&#8221; Possibly a strange response, but there we go.

Got me thinking about (human) clones, actually. Much musing to be had there. Maybe I&#8217;m just strange&#8230;
