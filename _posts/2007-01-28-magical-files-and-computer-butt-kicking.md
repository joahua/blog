My computer has done some amazing things this last 24 hours. It&#8217;s incredible what a spot of good software can do &#8212; I&#8217;ve installed Premiere Pro trial to tide me over 30 days until I *have* to pay for it (I&#8217;m hoping for some product announcement about version 3 software&#8230; it&#8217;s probably a long shot, but I&#8217;d be supremely annoyed to buy something that expensive only for it to be rendered &#8212; excuse the pun &#8212; obsolete within a week) and am revelling in its video processing power. How anyone can find this software complicated is beyond me: it is, simply, one of the most intuitive pieces of software I&#8217;ve used in a long time. It&#8217;s not quite as drag-control friendly as Photoshop is just yet (a few dialogs here and there seem to be not-quite-yet updated in this regard) but apart from that&#8230; polished. Brilliant.

Even, it seems, when it comes to locating files on disconnected network shares. There&#8217;s some seriously weird project file caching thing they&#8217;ve got going, but whatever it is, I like it.

I&#8217;m yet to figure out the Multi-Camera edit thing but until such a time as that starts working (it may be disabled in the trial?) I&#8217;ll just be editing the Gandevia&#8217;s (!!! That describes both Eddie *and* Hannah now!!!) wedding video the old fashioned way (no tape splicing, though).

And, oh yeah, that was yesterday. I had three cameras going and assurances that the cathedral&#8217;s vision stream was being recorded (to VHS, of all things, so I should&#8217;ve known better)&#8230; they lied. Well, probably not intentionally, but I scored a wonderful blank video tape for free out of the whole saga. So this could be an interesting wedding video when the safe camera stops working &#8212; it was a bloody DVD camera, which sucks. If you buy one of these things you should be shot. Not just because you can&#8217;t use them for editing, because most people don&#8217;t care about that, but because it&#8217;s damn near impossible to get hour-long DVDs for them, the quality is worse than miniDV, and the media costs more anyway!  
I went out of my way to locate hour long blank media but it carked it at 40 minutes&#8230; must&#8217;ve been set to a higher quality setting by accident. Still looks (relative to a crappy little DV Canon and an XL2 which I was carrying) like absolute rubbish. But it was a wide shot of the room that would&#8217;ve saved my butt if the Cathedral&#8217;s thing stopped working. Ironically, they both did.

Hooray for multiple technology failures!
