![A spiral of freshly cooked Tackles DVDs][1]

[TACKLES][2] is back again for another year next Sunday and we&#8217;re gonna try and sell parents the end of year video we made (yes, at the end of last year) for $5 a copy when they come down to rego for the year. Accordingly, the more reliable DVD burner here (it&#8217;s &#8212; surprisingly &#8212; a Sony, the other drive is a Liteon that plays up quite a lot) has been spinning nearly non-stop from about 5.30 til now. All done, though.

![TACKLES 06 DVD cover][3]

DVDs and so forth aside, it&#8217;s shaping up to be quite the exciting year. We&#8217;re kicking off with four weeks looking at why Paul wrote letters in the New Testament part of the Bible, which should be good fun. Will probably post more as the term progresses.
