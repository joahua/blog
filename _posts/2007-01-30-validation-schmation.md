I just realised I haven&#8217;t used the W3C validator in probably close to 6 months. I had some browser inconsistencies building CSS today and, whilst I don&#8217;t know the cause, the problem in question resolved itself a few hours later&#8230; I think because I must&#8217;ve just had poorly formed markup that I fixed without even bothering to note in my mind.

Well formed markup has its (decidedly useful) place, but we could all probably learn to live without validators quite happily!
