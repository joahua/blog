Going away to [Orient Point][1] again for a few days. Catching a train in about 45 minutes. Spent the morning hacking WordPress into submission without SSH or FTP access on [the Matthias website][2]. It looks ugly as anything but its butt got kicked so hard and it&#8217;s now behaving lots better. Design will come later (it should always come first, in hand with IA and usability). Still we&#8217;re working towards something useful for the not-too-distant future &#8212; it&#8217;s nothing spectacular, but it does do plenty the old site didn&#8217;t, and giving people a content management tool is a great thing in terms of culture-changing how people think about what a website is and ensuring it stays up to date.
