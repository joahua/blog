First time I&#8217;ve managed to do that and it was something really simple. I was dragging a bezier handle too far away from a keyframe and the component that was drawing the curve crashed&#8230; wasn&#8217;t even anything complicated! Goes to show that no matter how complex an app&#8217;s task is, it can still crash on (relatively) simple errands. I found it interesting. Probably you won&#8217;t :P
