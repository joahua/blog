Steve Jobs writes some [thoughts on the state of digital music][1] which cause me to smile quite a lot. Maybe it&#8217;s time to download iTunes afterall.

> Perhaps those unhappy with the current situation should redirect their energies towards persuading the music companies to sell their music DRM-free.Â Â For Europeans, two and a half of the big four music companies are located right in their backyard.Â Â The largest, Universal, is 100% owned by Vivendi, a French company.Â Â EMI is a British company, and Sony BMG is 50% owned by Bertelsmann, a German company.Â Convincing themÂ to license their music to Apple and others DRM-free will createÂ a truly interoperable music marketplace.Â Apple will embrace this wholeheartedly.
