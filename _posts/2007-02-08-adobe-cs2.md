Just got home with it. 9 discs. Cost-per-disc works out cheaper than most games. Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign/GoLive/Acrobat 8 (read *that*  
twice, free upgrade goodness!)/Dreamweaver plus two resource discs (lots of fonty goodness and some templates I&#8217;ll probably never use), a video training thing, and a partridge in a pear tree.

![Adobe CS2 Premium Academic Edition Asia Pacific/Australia region][1]

The box is nearly big enough to fit a [partridge][2] (whatever that is) in, too.
