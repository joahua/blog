I don&#8217;t even particularly blame it, but it&#8217;s not working on [whisper][1] (faithfully serving in a cupboard since early-2005) anymore. It was running 5.10 (I think) for yonks and then today I decided it might be easier/cleaner to pull the plug and re-install than just change the apt sources for a third time (or however many it&#8217;s been)

So I downloaded 6.10 (hence the torrent post) and it didn&#8217;t work.

Fine. I downloaded 6.06 LTS (the, you know, meant-to-be-Ã¼berstable-and-longlasting release) and it hangs loading the kernel. No kernel panic message, it just gets stuck.

This is annoying.

I&#8217;m basically going to rebuild this entire server for [Django][2]&#8216;s sake, because it&#8217;s so useful for non-programmers like me to build things that work. This has been an interesting week [at church][3] because a whole bunch of new things started/old things restarted and finally I&#8217;m in a position to evaluate where we can use technology from an &#8220;insider&#8221; standpoint with regards to what I&#8217;m being paid to do at [Youthworks][4].

I&#8217;ve got two smallish (with potential for massive extension) apps that I want to build in under two days for ongoing internal use (one for [TACKLES][5], another for my [Switch][6] small group this year) which will essentially form prototypes for revision/replacement as appropriate for use in a CYIADA global context once we get a programmer on board (God willing sometime soon! I&#8217;m meeting with someone who will hopefully be helpful in this regard on Friday, please be praying!) and make some more concrete decisions about architecture. I can draw flowcharts until there&#8217;s nothing left to flow but that doesn&#8217;t get business logic written!

I&#8217;m thinking the Ubuntu issue will be some stupid hardware thing that will go away once I take the computer apart. It probably needs a bit of a clean, anyway. I just so don&#8217;t have time to spend on sysadminy type stuff these days, only no-one else at work will/is interested in doing it, which is rather annoying &#8212; there&#8217;s free hosting, but it&#8217;s seriously the most vanilla hosting environment you&#8217;re likely to find anywhere. It&#8217;s a CPanel/WHM gig with zero redundancy, zero backups, PHP4 only, and blah blah blah no-one cares. Generic with a capital G set in Times New Roman. There is, of course, little interest in anything using a non-.Net platform. I&#8217;d actually quite happily use MSSQL, but ASP.Net is, by all reports, just gross from a web standards perspective. And whilst I&#8217;m slowly being de-radicalised in that regard (partially because I am caring less about standards and more about accessibility, which is bad long term anyway, and also because my viewpoints are becoming less radical as mainstream moves towards where I am now! CSS is the norm, and pure content/presentation separated sites are probably representing 50% of site refreshes at the minute), I&#8217;m not quite ready to throw in the towel that much just yet.

Nor should I be.
