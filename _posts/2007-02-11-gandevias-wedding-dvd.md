Snazzy huh? :P I was pleased at how it came out&#8230; I&#8217;m continually surprised by [our Photosmart][3]&#8216;s capabilities, it really does well if you feed it slightly thicker stock paper (I usually use this great 190GSM stuff by Nopa &#8212; some European company, they don&#8217;t even have a website that I know of).

And yes, Photoshop was used in the production of this DVD cover ;-)
