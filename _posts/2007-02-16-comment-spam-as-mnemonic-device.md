I love it. It (sometimes) pulls ancient posts out that just haven&#8217;t seen the light of day for years, and sticks them in front of your nose all over again. I just [re-discovered][1] [SQL Designer][2] and it&#8217;s still just as awesome. It needs an export method to generate Django models ;-)

Oh&#8230; and, in case you were wondering, I still deleted the spam comment (it was one of the rare ones that sneaks past Akismet).
