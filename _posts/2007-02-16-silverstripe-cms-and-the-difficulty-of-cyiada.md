I stumbled across [this PHP5 CMS][1] today (via a WSG member post) and it looks pretty good. I&#8217;m a little concerned about the (very)-AJAX admin side of things, but didn&#8217;t spend much time digging into it so it might gracefully degrade (maybe).

It&#8217;s almost frustrating to find such good and mature CMS products on the market and not have any need to use them for CYIADA&#8230; I spent the last week mostly trying to shape fairly simple data models for different aspects of the website and it&#8217;s rapidly becoming clear just how structurally complex multi-tiered community/community generated content sites are. At least in terms of relational DB complexity, yes, this is bigger than MySpace.

Anyway, SilverStripe looks worth a look for simpler endevours.

The complexity is mostly introduced where users become authors, which defies traditional CMS workflow altogether. It&#8217;s also far more structured than Wiki systems are, and far more private. Privacy is being balanced against flexibility which is being balanced against community and *all* of these are being met with time/cost concerns.

But I like to keep telling myself I don&#8217;t really know what I&#8217;m talking about and getting a programmer will solve all these dilemmas &#8230; yeah, right.

I&#8217;ve got sick of sitting on my hands and just want to be a web practitioner again. I know the product inside out, it&#8217;s been planned to the hilt, stakeholders are universally intrigued/waiting for it, and I&#8217;m being impatient and feeling generally like charging forwards. Which is, in all probability, not the best way to be approaching things.

These two consultants came in a week ago and we explained the project to them and (what I heard was) they said &#8220;we want flowcharts and scope documents&#8221;. I&#8217;ve killed a few trees in my time, but the next person to help me in that isn&#8217;t going to be a consultant telling me to rehash (yet again &#8212; I&#8217;ve written documents in so many forms, website copy so many times, etc.) what I&#8217;ve got without any further input. I&#8217;m in this weird place now where waiting for a programmer is nearly <span style="font-style: italic">required</span> for further planning action, and everyone but me appears to want more planning <span style="font-style: italic">before</span> action&#8230; meanwhile, I&#8217;m writing models for Django and scaring myself with the complexity and learning Adobe products better and generally landing squarely back in front-end territory, which is where I&#8217;ve comfortably been for the last two or so years. Well, with the exception of Adobe products, which I only [finally caved to][2] last year&#8230; whatever :P
