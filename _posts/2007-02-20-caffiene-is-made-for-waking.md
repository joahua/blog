And that&#8217;s just what it&#8217;ll do.  
I made the mistake of ordering an affogato at about 8 this evening, thinking that between going out with some friends after & general geeking out when I got home after, I&#8217;d be in bed by a fairly reasonable time (like 1am or thereabouts).

Clearly, I was wrong. Ah well&#8230; It&#8217;s been a good several hours! I don&#8217;t drink coffee often, as evidenced by the fact that a single shot of espresso can keep me up til 3 in the morning! On the plus side, I started learning InDesign by designing a timetable! It&#8217;s a sufficiently unpolished beast (as is Illlustrator) on PC when compared against Photoshop (and, to a lesser extent, Premiere Pro), but it feels far simpler than Illustrator.

I&#8217;ve recently subscribed to [Before & After magazine][1] and they&#8217;ve got some articles around using Illustrator, and when I see how it&#8217;s done things *do* just click, but I still feel a very long way from anything vaguely resembling proficiency with the app.

If you&#8217;d care to know what I consider &#8220;proficiency&#8221;, basically I just mean being able to sit with a client and have Illustrator in front of you and use it without embarrassment. I&#8217;m inches away from that goal with Photoshop, and Premiere Pro has always felt like something I can just guess at and get right 95% of the time, but for the rest of Creative Suite/Production Studio&#8230; not so much.
