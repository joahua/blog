I don&#8217;t know what kind of Internet access work are using (well, I know *who* they&#8217;re using: it&#8217;s not quite the same), but they should seriously think about changing things around a bit. Aside from wierd peering issues a few months back, now they&#8217;ve just dropped off the face of the planet for \*counts\* I think about three days now. Predictably, someone is pointing the finger at Telstra.

Everyone always points at Telstra. Customers don&#8217;t care whose fault it is &#8212; they&#8217;re paying whomever to provide a reliable service, not Telstra. Upstream contracts/networks are someone elses&#8217; responsibility altogether!

It&#8217;s pretty abysmal that it takes three days to get Internet servicing more than 100 people working again&#8230; Sigh.

I&#8217;m here at home on perfectly functional Internet, but the things I&#8217;ve needed to do the last few days have involved the project website which has been equally unavailable. If I were a full time employee I&#8217;d have been paid for two days of doing nothing this week&#8230; why don&#8217;t people take redundancy a bit more seriously?!

It also may or may not be diplomatic for me to whinge about the corporate VoIP service they&#8217;re using at this point&#8230; it&#8217;s still working (presumably a separate link altogether), but it sounds like a really bad pre-DECT-era cordless telephone service, and that&#8217;s when your ears aren&#8217;t being blasted by the sounds of a modem as you dial in.

Grumble grumble. I might delete this post later if I think better of it&#8230; for the minute, suffice to say Josh is in a pretty bad mood about quality of service he&#8217;s meant to be depending upon. I learnt last week that I don&#8217;t have the freedom to negotiate service contracts (yes, even where none expressly providing that kind of service yet exist &#8212; think mobiles&#8230;) which made me a little upset (because I thought I&#8217;d done really well talking with a certain vendor who will remain nameless), but saw the point of it all. But when reliability gets this bad, for an all-online venture, I am afraid to entrust hosting to that kind of environment. You can get really good hosting in Oz for way under $300/month (and even less if you&#8217;re prepared to commit to contracts, because that&#8217;s the way most Aussie providers do things) &#8212; not necessarily [myth-of-the-nines][1] hosting ([SegPub are one hosting company][2] with a really good rep, but they only do a 99.5% SLA), but waaay better than *three days* of downtime in a month.

In case you were wondering, that works out to about 90% availability per annum. And it&#8217;s not necessarily going to flake out at times no-one is using it, and, given the demographic, it&#8217;s not an office-hours-only kind of service. And I wouldn&#8217;t be looking at alternate service providers because&#8230;?

(Yeah I&#8217;ll probably pull this article soon&#8230; just wanted to whine.)
