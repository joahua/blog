Dependence on God in prayer is appropriate because He is all knowing, loving, and powerful. Inaction masquerading as dependence isn&#8217;t, because He is all knowing, loving, and powerful. Prayer and bringing stuff before God doesn&#8217;t mean forgetting about that stuff/thinking He&#8217;ll take it out of your sight. There&#8217;s no reason to anticipate that God mightn&#8217;t involve you in answering your own prayers &#8212; in fact, there&#8217;s much more reason to expect that he may.

He&#8217;s prepared works in advance for us to do, and Ephesians chapter 2 says that we&#8217;re created in Christ Jesus (that is, I think, re-born as Christians accepting Christ as Lord over our lives) for this purpose. Action is an essential part of our being created/becoming Christian.

Elsewhere in the New Testament, we&#8217;re told that &#8220;it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure&#8221; [ESV translation, from Philippians chapter 2:13] and, elsewhere [1 Cor 2:16],Ã‚ that we have the mind of Christ &#8212; so our will and God&#8217;s should line up. The letter to the Colossians talks about our seeing that we &#8220;have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator&#8221;.

So, if the will of God and His people is to line up, it&#8217;s ridiculous to think that praying is some kind of personally-empty endevour &#8212; it&#8217;s not just a matter of putting things on a plate before God, saying &#8220;here you are, deal with it&#8221;, and walking away without another glance back. No, we&#8217;re being changed into the image of God, which means denying (literally meaning, to disown or deny utterly) self and following Christ alone.

> If we have died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us; if we are faithless, he remains faithful&#8211; for he cannot deny himself.

> [ESV, 2 Timothy chapter 2:11]

Living with him means being prepared &#8212; indeed, expecting &#8212; to be used by God in answer to some things we come before him to ask. Of course, we&#8217;re still ultimately dependent upon God for forgiveness&#8211;&#8221;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#8221; In all these things we can only depend upon the love of God in sending his son, Jesus, to take our place&#8230; and we should be prepared respond to the enormity of that sacrifice.
