I just did the maths and figured out that if I were to spend an average of 0.4 seconds checking each spam message that evil people threw my way, I&#8217;d have already saved two hours of my life because of Akismet&#8217;s filtering.

Two. Hours. I only started using it on the 13th of January &#8212; that&#8217;s a little over a month ago. Just *using* Akismet wins me back half a day every year! (Probably more, coz 0.4 seconds is for scanning over each spam message, not including the time it takes to flag *legitimate* messages that wind up in mod queues and save them)
