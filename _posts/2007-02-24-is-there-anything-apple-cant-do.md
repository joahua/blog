I know this is an old story, but I stumbled across it again today & found the phrasing amusing:

> â€œThey revolutionised Britainâ€™s music industry, conquered America and now the Beatles are set to dominate the download charts after settling a trademark dispute with Apple computers.â€

Apple computers can be used to settle trademark disputes! Yes, even lawyers can use them!

Heh.
