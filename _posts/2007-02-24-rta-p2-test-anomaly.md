I just was looking through some paperwork (room cleaning goodness&#8230;) and discovered an RTA paper, which reminded me that I didn&#8217;t get my eyes tested when I got a new license last week. So I could be driving blind and they&#8217;d never know, heh. :|

I &lt;3 government agencies.Ã‚ (Bondi Junction, in case you were wondering).

(And, just for the record, my vision&#8217;s completely fine&#8230; the door hiding the eye test was open a tiny crack and I could make out one of the letters on the bottom line okay)
