Can&#8217;t wait. Just watched this [CS3 preview video][1] and am generally quite pumped. Mind you I&#8217;ve spent the day going between conversations about design so that&#8217;s probably a part of it. I&#8217;m especially excited by the new selection mode, but the perspective thing has got me pretty pumped, too. I actually hadn&#8217;t discovered that existed in CS2 yet, but it&#8217;s frustrating now knowing that angle selection is coming and I haven&#8217;t got access to it yet! Bring it on. Adobe just keep coming up with ways to send me broke!
