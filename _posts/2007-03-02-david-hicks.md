[This makes me angry][1]. I believe it to be, in large part anyway, truthful. I have no elaborate political response to give other than general disgust. It is curious that mainstream media (i.e. film: *Children of Men*, *V for Vendetta*, etc.) should borrow so effectively from contemporary events but to such innocuous effect. Matters are *not* apparently as bad as they [were] in Guantanamo, and the extrapolation of these methods of government is, in my experience, more likely to desensitise than mobilise an audience.

(And no, I will not vote for The Greens. Some evils are greater than others.)
