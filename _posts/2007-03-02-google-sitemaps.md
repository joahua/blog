I&#8217;ve had to disable Google Sitemaps for this site in a bid to stop post and comment form submissions resulting in a blank page. Probably gonna negate a bit of the Google Love but that&#8217;s okay, the blank pages have been driving me batty! WordPress plugin Google Sitemaps basically uses too much memory (I think&#8230; PHP error reporting isn&#8217;t turned on on this server so I can&#8217;t be 100% sure)&#8230; last time it succeeded it wrote a 3MB file I think. Could also be a gzip related issue but I doubt it (gzip works fine for other things IIRC).

So enjoy commenting again without a horribly blank screen greeting you!
