Morons. And today I do not count myself in their midst.

I am currently being irritated by the slightest show of ignorance in any web-related discipline. WSG list is royally pissing me off at the minute. I am quite aware the problem is probably my own and very little to do with the relative intelligence of the wider Internet.

Grumble grumble grumble.
