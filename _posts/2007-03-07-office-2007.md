Please stop me if I am making a fool of myself by overflowing with gushing praise for this thing, but, seriously, the best $75 I ever spent on software. (Yes, you can get [the latest Office Ultimate for $75 if you&#8217;re a student. Legit.][1])

The new version of Word is a thing of beauty. It just works, and makes sense, and is generally a usability wonder. I&#8217;m sure someone will publish a study to the contrary in the next week, but I don&#8217;t care &#8212; it is perfectly intuitive to a non-Office literate user. Yes, that is myself&#8211;I&#8217;ve battled with OO.org for years, and am utterly convinced it sucks. I have occasionally fought with MS Office products in this time, and battled slightly less, but still it&#8217;s felt like I&#8217;m doing things the slow way. Every essay I&#8217;ve written over the last eighteen months is stored in LyX (LaTeX) format: I&#8217;ve basically not used a word processor for anything serious in at least that long. And I haven&#8217;t used a Microsoft word processor at home for three years (on a horrible laptop), and not on my primary desktop computer for four, or possibly five. Historical perspective: I started using Windows when I was 7, stopped when I was 15 or 16, and returned at 18 Â½ &#8212; Microsoft have got good reason to be trying to bring me back into the family, because I&#8217;ve been away for a long time.

I am as upset as the next web developer about the [Outlook team&#8217;s brain-dead decision to switch back to Word as the primary rich email rendering engine][2], but will wax lyrical about the *new calendaring features in Outlook!!* For they are greatly beautiful. Observe my three calendars (Organised into: Personal & Work; Uni; Church) layered together here:

Groove makes me shrug enormously, it does nothing useful for me. Unless it&#8217;s like Sharepoint only&#8230; good. But even then, I&#8217;ve never dug that whole Intranet collaborative thang. Really, if I were going to run bloat-inducing collaborative software, I should start with Adobe&#8217;s Version Cue. But I don&#8217;t use it because&#8230; too many apps in my tray annoys me, and Firefox eats all my memory as is (screeny from yesterday&#8230; it peaked at about 1GB but I couldn&#8217;t be bothered taking another):

![Firefox using the better part of 1GB of RAM][4]

The only reason I still use that bloody browser is its extensions support: Firebug has stolen my heart where Office 2007 hasn&#8217;t yet. Here&#8217;s its asset download graphy thingamijig:

It&#8217;s even better than Chris Pederick&#8217;s toolbar. But oh how I&#8217;d love to switch to Opera (or even, shock, IE) full time now. Firefox really isn&#8217;t doing it for me with its bloat these days.

Speaking of bloat, Office 2007 is *one* 500MB download. It doesn&#8217;t download a 500MB stub and then install the rest &#8212; no, that includes Word, Outlook, Powerpoint, Excel, Publisher, &#8230; and all the other random crap I installed but will probably never use. Fantastic.

Everything is pretty fast (but it emphatically encourages you to install Windows Live Desktop, and seeing as I&#8217;m a beta tester for other Live stuff pretty willingly, I figured I may as well, and when you first install that indexing makes everything chug) which is excellent &#8212; but I&#8217;m still looking to buy a new dual core 939 sometime soon. Graphics are fine because I have no intention of upgrading to Vista (read: needing DirectX 10 and a $1000 graphics card) in the next 18 months at least, but&#8230; well, another 2GB of RAM would go down nicely. Shame it&#8217;s still relatively expensive, though.

Microsoft, I wasn&#8217;t going to pirate your software because it&#8217;s not *that* good, but thanks for the discount, anyway!
