Okay, so maybe I spoke too soon.

Its interface is wonderfully improved, its typesetting now is vastly more tolerable, and it&#8217;s still full of bugs.

I just tried to print a document and it failed to include one image out of thirteen. I tried to print to a PDF file (using Acrobat, because the inbuilt PDF plugin is crap and won&#8217;t respect the Word multiple sheets/page setting), in case it was just the printer being lame &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t.

Who thought it might be a good idea to release a word processor that can&#8217;t print?

Obviously they scrapped their beta testing programme so they could afford to give it away for $75 to people who&#8217;d otherwise pirate it anyway \*rolls eyes\*
