Wow&#8230; the timing is so bizarre I can barely believe it.

I stumbled across this post [announcing support for OpenID on the Pixelsoup blog of JadedPixel, makers of Shopify][1]. I&#8217;m not entirely convinced this even makes sense here, but whatever &#8212; it&#8217;s fascinating.

On the plus side, [Shopify][2] appeared to have disappeared off the face of the planet (in terms of stagnation) for a couple of months there, but their blog at least is alive and kicking. Certainly not for consumption by [tomorrow&#8217;s audience][3], but potentially good for some e-commerce applications.

There is no [WordPress][4] of online shop software, which is slightly irritating. A great opportunity for a very high profile open source project: take [OsCommerce][5] and make it user-friendly and generally not-crappily-interfaced right out of the box! WordPress *has* done a few innovative feature things, but I reckon most of its success has been built on the grounds that it&#8217;s free software (heck, it wouldn&#8217;t exist if it couldn&#8217;t have forked B2) and the work they&#8217;ve poured into the interface.

I&#8217;m posting too much geeky stuff. Something non-geeky to come soon, I hope.
