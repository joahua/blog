Two articles from The Sun-Herald & The Age today contrasted starkly and got me sufficiently upset. An Australian company [unveils a brain interface system][1] for application with computer games, which is quite geeky and, quite frankly, very cool.

&#8220;US reports suggested children took to the system more quickly than adults who were less able to engage in fantasy.&#8221;

Yes, okay. I&#8217;d love to be able to use this to get things done in Photoshop more quickly &#8212; its applications seem primarily creative in nature rather than simply replacing a keyboard, etc., but that&#8217;s not really what upset me.

Excuse The Age&#8217;s horrifically sensationalistic &#8220;[TV blamed for rise in child-speech problems][2]&#8221; headline, but the actual article isn&#8217;t that rubbish. Essentially, it attributes an anecdotal rise in speech problems and a quantifiable detection-associated rise in referrals to speech pathologists.

> &#8220;There is good data to show that the more often you sit around a dining room table and have a conversation around a meal, the better the language development of children,&#8221; he said.
> 
> Psychologists in Britain were running a campaign called Back to the Table to try to get families to share meals together around a table on a regular basis.

I&#8217;m not so concerned by it because I don&#8217;t have kids. I&#8217;m concerned by it because I deal with kids probably just enough to notice.

Funny how two articles so often crop up on the same day so starkly undermining one another&#8217;s message!

For all the rhetorical garbage that media studies & digital culture (described by a lecturer as having emerged from sociology, only without method &#8212; I jest not) spew out about how we should eschew the pessimistic futurists that tell us new media is only serving to distance us all&#8230; they are, in my view, quite plainly ignoring at least some of the impacts of these emerging mediums.

This is frustrating. I want to believe technology is pedagogically advantageous, but struggle immensely with its application even where there are fantastic (technology, not content) resources available&#8211;and I&#8217;m a geek. Admittedly, that&#8217;s no qualification to teach, but it should at least mean *some* kind of creativity where the two meet. Or not.

Mostly, though, this isn&#8217;t about technology at all. It&#8217;s about its effects, intended or otherwise &#8212; and particularly for children. I don&#8217;t even see the speech problems so much as the things that surround them, in the forms of attention span & relational difficulties with both friends (less common) and family. Please be praying for wisdom in thinking through how best to deal with these issues.

(Yes, I am still saying I want to do secondary teaching. I feel like I&#8217;m slowly being changed to have an openness to either secondary or primary, though. If you feel so inclined, pray about that, too!)
