Okay.

For whatever reason, I wasn&#8217;t paying attention when I bought CS2.

I somehow failed to realise that Production Studio Pro has nearly all the same things (ex. DTP stuff that I don&#8217;t *really* have much of a use for, but it&#8217;s nice having anyway) and more (Premiere, AfterEffects) for&#8230; not a lot more money at all.

\*breathes deeply\*

On the plus side, [Creative Suite 3 is launching later this month][1] though I don&#8217;t know if that means the next version of Premiere just yet. So I&#8217;ll wait til that&#8217;s an option before purchasing Production Studio, which means I get CS3 versions of the stuff I actually use &#8212; Photoshop & Illustrator &#8212; and still have CS2 of non-essentials, like InDesign, GoLive, etc. Acrobat is going to be alright for a while coz I&#8217;ve already got Acrobat 8 because of relatively-late acquisition of CS2. Dreamweaver&#8230; I don&#8217;t particularly care about, though I&#8217;ve happily used it for various things.

And yeah, I&#8217;m still going to uni and doing all that sorta thing, so it&#8217;s cheaper. I&#8217;m just vaguely annoyed I didn&#8217;t drop $200 more for Production Studio when I could&#8217;ve if I&#8217;d read a bit more, but it&#8217;s done now. Hopefully they&#8217;ll launch a new version of that along with CS3 so I can pick it up soon after the end of this month.

One day I might even make a decent amount of money out of this :P My reasoning is that living at home & studying = good time for doing loss-running, skill- and network-building, moderately-expensive-but-just-within-means geeky things.

At the minute I&#8217;m not *losing* money on it, but it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;d be able to afford to do if I were dependent on regular income for rent, or whatever. Speaking of regularity, John C & I ran job interviews yesterday and decided to get one of the applicants onboard for CYIADA! So now that enters the build phase & we&#8217;re actually going to be MakingStuffâ„¢ that&#8217;ll become more directed and stable &#8212; not in a financial sense, but just in a number-of-hours-a-week kinda way. At the minute my hours have fluctuated a bit depending on what I&#8217;ve been able to think of/motivated to get done, but that&#8217;ll obviously stabilise a lot as I move back to cutting code and actually seeing it develop!

Anyway. Can&#8217;t wait.
