  - usual print-web mindset problem methinks
---
I officially don&#8217;t get it. Mind you I&#8217;m working from a CMYK file at some bizarre resolution and it&#8217;s just not scaling properly at all, so it&#8217;s probably not entirely my fault&#8230; the usual print-web mindset problem methinks. Only this is extra frustrating coz it&#8217;s due by this evening and I&#8217;ve got a Shakespeare scene to workshop this evening also&#8230; so I&#8217;ve basically got 3 hours left to build an entire website. Crap.
