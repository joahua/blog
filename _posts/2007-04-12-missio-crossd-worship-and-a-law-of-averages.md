What is a &#8216;mission&#8217;? How do you reconcile the meaning you associate with that and its Latin root, *missio*, to send, and actual use of the term? Why do we talk about a &#8220;mission to do *x*&#8221; and hereafter refer to &#8220;mission&#8221; as though it encompassed &#8220;to do *x*&#8221; itself, rather than the act of sending?

What on earth is a life centred on two bits of wood hurriedly nailed together and stained crimson? Do people worship symbols on particularly sugary buns?

I think this website is a measure of discontentment. I rarely post when there is nothing to grumble about, because good news is apparently boring. This website makes me feel guilty. It&#8217;s one big occasionally-ugly mirror. I don&#8217;t look into it when things are good, and pour the bad into it the rest of the time interspersed with geeky things&#8230; a slightly acquisitive load of rubbish designed to obfuscate and create a false set of values that improve (in the eye of the beholder, for a time) the reflection. It&#8217;s easy to forget these things.

At any rate, blogs are a useless journal medium. Too much happens in any given day. Yesterday, I installed QuickBooks and realised that absolute morons are able to run their own businesses with good reason and it needn&#8217;t be so hard afterall. \*insert rant about software\*

Tax is predictably boring stuff, though, so when Claud suggested we go see [Becoming Jane][1] (contrary to rumours *I* dragged *her* along &#8212; though if she hadn&#8217;t, I would have done&#8230; we enjoyed it for different reasons, I maintain!) I was there in a matter of&#8230; well, about an hour. Somewhere in the middle we went shopping for food & ate lunch. \*insert rant about the film, about the wonderful speed-distraction medium that IM is, and maybe others\*

Spent a lazy-enough afternoon at her house until a phone call promised poker and food of the barbecued variety at Gareth&#8217;s place, which ended in two particularly dim-witted hands, and some interesting reading of Time magazine&#8217;s global warming issue. Some of the 51 ideas printed were on the mark, others seemed a little less so (energy efficient lighting was one I know enough about to take issue with, hybrid cars were thankfully nowhere that I could see). \*insert rant about global warming bandwagon\*

Later, I started contributing more carbon by trying to drive Budd&#8217;s car (a manual, I&#8217;d only drive a manual lawnmower in the past) as he listened to his clutch slowly being torn to shreds. \*insert rant about manual/auto transmission and licensing and the like\*

There are other funny stories to be shared within that, but each of those comprises an entire post of its own. I have no interest in chronicling my life with that degree of detail. Perhaps if I were a [Dickinson][2]-esque recluse I&#8217;d have time enough to write and little enough to write about that I might write more. But thankfully I&#8217;m not.
