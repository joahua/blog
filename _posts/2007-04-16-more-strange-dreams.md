An assessment turned cook-off. What does this have to do with cyberspace? Nothing, but that&#8217;s not the point. We&#8217;ve got (an indeterminate period of time, as is common in dreams?) to cook&#8230; well, cook something. Normally I&#8217;d protest, but we&#8217;re already in the assessment room and&#8230; well, it can&#8217;t end that badly.

But then our group was the last to finish, someone is arriving to taste-test, and we end up hiding in another room, not quite done. At that point there is an attempt to make the room look nice, scrounging a table from a bench, finding a tablecloth&#8230; and re-wiring house lighting into the right spot using only alfoil.

There was also another particularly irritating dream about a vision mixer that was a piece of crap and a whole bunch of people who didn&#8217;t know how to use it. And another one about how I talked too much and could I please shut up and give other people a chance to sometimes. So I did, and then I couldn&#8217;t attempt to tell people what they were doing wrong because of a matrix-esque &#8220;what-good-is-a-phonecall-if&#8221; fusion of the lips. Something to do with the beauty and horror of human relationships.

There is, of course, a certain un-veracity about all of this by its very nature. Even if I were making it all up, that says something too, does it not? I did not dream about truthfulness.
