A series of photos taken by Nic on a particularly wet day. Probably more to come.

Download: [1024&#215;768][2], [1280&#215;800][3], [1280&#215;1024][4], [1440&#215;900][5], [2560&#215;1024 (1280 dual monitor)][6]

The dual monitor version is my wallpaper at the minute! It looks good, but makes me crave a good second monitor even more. One day.
