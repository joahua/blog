The things you find&#8230;

![Sony Trinitron Multiscan CPD-G420][1]

The one on the right is replacing the one on the left. The one on the right was found on the street &#8211; the one on the left was found in a rubbish dump a few months earlier. My secondary monitor just got an upgrade&#8230; I&#8217;ll be putting off that new LCD purchase for another couple of months!

And yes, that is Premiere Pro on the screen. [CS3 has a free Beta available][2]&#8230; I&#8217;m really loving it! It&#8217;s crippled in many ways but if you can&#8217;t afford Premiere and don&#8217;t already have an earlier version it&#8217;s a pretty good option. I&#8217;m probably going to install the free Beta on a secondary computer once CS3 goes gold and I buy the real thing&#8230; so there can be one real version that does everything, and another production-capable workstation also running CS3. Speaking of which, two projectors, two vision mixers, three cameras, two PC&#8217;s, a DVD player, a couple of radio mics and a whole bucketload of cables are getting a workout tomorrow evening for a cooking evening. Should be interesting&#8230; but I desperately need sleep now to be awake for then. Need more time to just veg and blog and talk to people and stuff&#8230; ahhh! \*head explosion\* Next week should be an improvement&#8230;
