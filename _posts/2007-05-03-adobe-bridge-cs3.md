It does a lot of things right. CS2 was good in its integration but pretty mediocre in thumbnailing and metadata support, but this is finally an app worth having. The filter (bottom left) is magical; the thumbnailing isn&#8217;t horrifically compressed like it used to be; resizing using the slider is a lot faster; there are three different immensely-useful views built in&#8230;

It&#8217;s just good. And lots lots *lots* faster to use than CS2 is (load time is similar, but once you&#8217;re actually using it&#8230; pure gold).
