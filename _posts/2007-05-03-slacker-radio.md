<p>This service rocks. It&#8217;s free, has a pretty good range of music, <em>and</em> is guaranteed to make me buy more music (on CD, because all electronic music download services are still either illegal or stupid).</p>
<p>The Flash player kicks butt (there&#8217;s a desktop one coming soon), and intelligently hooks into the webpage&#8217;s markup to update the title with every new song. It&#8217;s gold. <em>Song Title</em> by <em>Artist</em> from <em>Album Name</em>. It says Album Name! I&#8217;m sitting here scribbling down must-acquire &#8217;90s music.</p>
<p>It uses AAC2+ apparently&#8230; all I really know is that it sounds great and is stupidly easy to use.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>But possibly unsustainable&#8230; none of my money is going to <em>them.</em> They&#8217;re launching hardware devices, so this might just be a ploy to get people to buy them, but I&#8217;m more interested in who&#8217;s doing all the work. There&#8217;s absolutely zero crowd-sourcing going on here that I can see&#8230; which means that &#8220;Related Artists&#8221; list is all professionally programmed. I know the Top Stations are, but the artists bit is going a little far perhaps&#8230;</p>
<p>Triple J Unearthed and Myspace and PureVolume, etc., all do it the other way around, which seems infinitely more sensible&#8230; but you need critical mass to get there, I suppose.</p>
<p>One to watch. And listen to.</p>
