I had a sudden compulsion to make my BH-501 work at last with Windows after one too many late-night &#8220;I can&#8217;t use speakers and can no longer abide cables for crappy earphones&#8221; moments. If I had money enough to blow $200 on a decent set of headphones expressly for the purpose of sitting at the PC late at night, sure, but I don&#8217;t at the minute. So my mobile&#8217;s Bluetooth headphones do a decent job in the time being.

The magical secret, it seems, is Bluesoleil&#8217;s <a HREF="http://www.bluesoleil.com/products/index.asp?topic=bluesoleil_edr">free EDR Bluetooth manager software</a> that allegedly has a 20MB data transfer limitation per session until it&#8217;s purchased, but I&#8217;ve just downloaded it and done over 50MB of audio data transfers in A2DP streams and it&#8217;s not complaining. Plus, Buy/Register under the Help menu are greyed out&#8230; so I don&#8217;t know quite how serious they are about selling this thing.

At any rate, it&#8217;s working great for me, though my crappy Bluetooth dongle slows *EVERYTHING* about this computer down&#8230; must try another one, it&#8217;s not A2DP&#8217;s fault because whenever I pair my mobile with it to sync the same thing happens &#8212; even when nothing&#8217;s paired, as soon as you plug the dongle in (USB) everything starts crawling.

All that said, BlueSoleil are great. Works well.
