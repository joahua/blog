The language bar will randomly change languages, and randomly disappear, and because it&#8217;s handled at an application-specific level (admittedly a largely sensible decision) this means restarting applications just to change the language. This pisses me off immensely. Almost to the point of &#8220;if Vista did it better I&#8217;d consider switching&#8221;, and I don&#8217;t even have that much to do with languages other than english.

I&#8217;ve not used this much on anyone else&#8217;s system, but haven&#8217;t done anything particularly crazy with it and it still sucks&#8230; soooo&#8230; I blame Windows. I&#8217;m almost certain mainstream Linux distros can handle this better, but know nothing about how OS X deals with it&#8230; shrug.
