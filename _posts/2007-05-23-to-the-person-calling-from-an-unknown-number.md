I will not answer. Stop trying. Leave voicemail if you feel so inclined, but unless I&#8217;m *expecting* a call from an unknown number in that range of about five minutes, I&#8217;m not going to pick up. I dislike talking to people I don&#8217;t know well over the phone at the best of times, but people I potentially don&#8217;t know at all? No thanks.

Thankyou for your attention.
