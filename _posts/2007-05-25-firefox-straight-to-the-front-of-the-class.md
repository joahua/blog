Whenever I need to find Firefox in task manager, it doesn&#8217;t ever take long. Firefox is the fat kid of web browsers&#8230; it&#8217;s kind of hard for it to hide. If it once were a sleek, lean fox, today it&#8217;s caught just a few too many stray chickens and drunk a little too much of [Bean&#8217;s apple cider][1]. It wouldn&#8217;t take any bulldozers to find this fox, just a moderate sized keyboard with three keys (no prizes for guessing the three-finger&#8217;d salute).

I haven&#8217;t had a great day with Firefox. Well&#8230; I spent 3-4 hours in meetings today, so I didn&#8217;t even have that much *time* with Firefox! Still managed to let me down twice, though.

Damn its indisposable development tools \*sobs uncontrollably\*

I think I&#8217;ll switch back to Opera for all non-development Internet-related activity for a while&#8230; unless anyone has any other browser recommendations? I&#8217;ve seriously thought about IE7, but its rendering is *still* just a little too patchy for me to be able to live with myself as an Internet user.

Bleh. Let it be observed: even high-profile open source does not always lead to a good product. Its memory management is nothing short of repulsive. It will regularly use more memory than Photoshop and Illustrator combined &#8212; admittedly, I use Photoshop mostly for web production and not high resolution print stuff (though that does happen a few times a week, and it won&#8217;t often go far beyond the 350MB that Firefox seems to manage fairly regularly)

I&#8217;m still using CS2, so there aren&#8217;t any magical CS3 memory management advances that make such a claim possible&#8230; Firefox just sucks :P

I&#8217;d blame Windows being in need of a reinstall (it&#8217;s been running since October&#8230; more than six months without death :P Plus I started out not being happy with it because it&#8217;d been installed from the guy I bought the computer off, I just hacked it to use my CD key instead of the one he&#8217;d used to test things&#8230; so it&#8217;s never been perfect), but really, it&#8217;s not that bad for any other application. I normally do a reboot once a week and things are fine&#8230; heavy duty graphics editing, occasional video editing, constant mail and occasional wordprocessing&#8230; and of all those things it is a *web browser* that can&#8217;t get it right. Perhaps I shouldn&#8217;t be so derisive about it seeing as I make a living off developing in this relatively simple world&#8230; but I am.

The flip side to all of that, of course, is that I&#8217;ve been trying to live (more) like a normal user the past few years. Essentially, recognising that it&#8217;s simpler to buy software than write it (WordPress, Flickr), using hackably-open technologies instead of truly open ones (WMA Lossless sans DRM), and a general abandonment of open source principles in favour of vastly improved productivity (Photoshop, Premiere, Office 2007, royalty-free stock).

It&#8217;s certainly paid off in terms of professional development and enhanced creative potential&#8230; but there&#8217;s something lost in not being able to hack visualisations hooked up to a webcam together on a command-line anymore. Admittedly, *that* sort of thing only comes around half a dozen times a year! But no matter, it&#8217;s all good fun. Given more friends who were into that sort of thing and some good music, I&#8217;d so live in the party house. I&#8217;ve not figured out how to do the same command-line video tricks using Windows just yet, so next time I&#8217;ll probably use Windows for visualisations (woo particle emitters!) and a separate Linux-powered laptop (maybe?) for webcam trickery. Then I&#8217;ll take webcam stuff straight out into Windows capture and skip my vis mixer altogether for once&#8230; I gotta learn to travel lighter anyway!
