[Remix07][1] looks awesome (and cheap). I&#8217;m already booked out for that week, which really sucks&#8230; even flying to Melbourne and staying overnight it looks like it&#8217;ll be a fantastic conference for&#8230; not lots more than a regular (i.e. non-MS subsidised) conference in Sydney. Its content is outside the scope of what I&#8217;d usually be interested in developing with, but I admit now to my insatiable curiosity into Silverlight, WPF, and the subtly-hinted-at media streaming aspects of the conference. Plus they&#8217;re giving away [Expression Web][2] to attendees, which would *nearly* &#8216;pay&#8217; for the trip anyway. Sigh. Maybe next year.
