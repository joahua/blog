It&#8217;s been seven months since my last exam. Seven months since using a pen was compulsory. Tomorrow afternoon could be interesting&#8230; at least it should be relatively warm due to the time of day. I&#8217;ve studied a little but not absurdly lots. Not too stressed, truth be told. Apparently arts degrees are a waste of time, anyway, so I have no reason to bother myself. I need to disappear for a while and work a lot, but that would close so many doors and I just know I&#8217;d never come back (to most of them). That moves from the realm of &#8220;miss&#8221; into &#8220;lament&#8221;. I came across a wonderful word in the marginalia to a certain poem of Eliot&#8217;s, wherein &#8220;high sentence&#8221; is explained as &#8220;sententiousness&#8221; (ironically, I had to find a definition for the explanation). The OED renders it thus:

1.  Full of meaning; also, of persons, full of intelligence or wisdom. *Obs.*
2.  Of the nature of a â€˜sentenceâ€™ or aphoristic saying.
3.  Of discourse, style, etc.: Abounding in pointed maxims, aphoristic. In recent use sometimes in bad sense, affectedly or pompously formal.
4.  Of persons: Given to the utterance of maxims or pointed sayings. Now often in bad sense, addicted to pompous moralizing.
5.  Of a symbol: Expressive of a whole sentence; opposed to *verbal*. *Obs.*
6.  Of composition: Consisting of detached sentences. *Obs.*

This word must get more of a workout. But if I weren&#8217;t studying arts, obscurantic cant would be altogether frowned upon. I was reading someone&#8217;s blog the other day (in a fit of procrastination, no doubt) who held Hemingway&#8217;s *The Sun Also Rises* to be a complete waste of time on account of the message of the book boiling down to &#8220;Humanity, you all suck and are powerless, etc.&#8221;. The blogger in question held it to be utterly redundant on account of Hemingway&#8217;s failure to offer a solution. It begs the &#8220;so what&#8221; question in its failure to propose action. Perhaps said blogger would do well to be a little more existentialist about literature. Literature serves as social entertainment at least as much as it serves as an avenue for problem resolution. And, if it&#8217;s any consolation to you, dear reader, if I were really feeling like a wanky arts student I would have made the word &#8220;problematise&#8221; (or one of its derivatives) a part of the previous sentence. There is hope for me yet (if only in that I loathe that word with a passion that escapes language itself, and along with that most who use it).
