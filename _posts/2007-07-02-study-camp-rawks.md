![Crusaders Winter Study Camp #1 2007 leaders photo][1]

Our leaders were all fantastic, Andrew was used so powerfully by God to speak to people who follow Jesus and those who don&#8217;t alike, and there were more engaging discussions had than at&#8230; somewhere that would have a lot of them. So many people seeking something, and so many who seem close to finding, but that&#8217;s all outside of our power. To God alone be the glory.
