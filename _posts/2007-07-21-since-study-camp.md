I have been to New Zealand; learnt to snowboard; entered a country alone for the first time; updated Facebook as a matter of first priority &#8212; surprising Claudia by turning up a day early was second, I should have reversed the two!; presented CYIADA (the name is changing, I haven&#8217;t shared it here just yet) to a large number of internal stakeholders, with whom the idea went down fairly well; started to feel on top of work; decided I&#8217;ll be doing less uni this semester (and probably will be on my own in the course, which is sad); started research into a project I&#8217;ve been wanting to get off the ground for some time now, with moderate degrees of success; and not spending nearly enough time on freelance commitments, but knowing it will provide good experience for CYIADA&#8217;s imminent implementation of similar things (yes, the freelance clients in question are aware of this motivation!).

I&#8217;ve also hit a bit of a slump in bible reading which isn&#8217;t magically solving itself&#8230; I put it down to playing too much catchup when I got back and not prioritising God&#8217;s word anywhere near as highly as I should have done. But now it&#8217;s a matter of actually resolving that before all of a sudden I&#8217;ve been back a month and still haven&#8217;t! Prayer is welcomed, of course.

I have also been sleeping well (if anti-socially?) &#8212; New Zealand does good things to you like that. I think I could quite happily live there, though a few more warm clothes would need acquisition first. That said, I have no plans to run away. Quite enough is keeping me here for the next 2 years or so, methinks. This is the latest I&#8217;ve been up in nearly a month methinks, so I&#8217;d best be off. More regular updates may be forthcoming at some point in the future. Life gets in the way of blogging sometimes &#8212; it&#8217;s not all bad!

p.s. yes, Harry Potter comes out in about seven hours. No, that does not qualify as &#8216;life&#8217;. (Close, though)
