Hitachi US have produced a number of <a HREF="http://www.hitachi.us/truestories/">particularly spectacular &#8220;true stories&#8221;</a> regarding their deployment of various technologies across the US. When I say spectacular, I&#8217;m not really referring to the plot of these stories, but just the production quality. It&#8217;s *very* well done. I think the target medium is exclusively the web, though I&#8217;m not certain &#8212; 5 minute packages are too long for TV by far, and marginally too long for cinema advertising. It&#8217;s quite good fun, though it&#8217;s difficult to identify a particular target. I clicked an ad to get there which was something to do with installing FTTN in some obscure US town (procrastinating), but&#8230; really&#8230; that was mostly because I didn&#8217;t know Hitachi were a service provider (turns out, I think, they&#8217;re not&#8230; but the ad seemed that way)

What I want to know is, why do infrastructure companies need lots of positive PR? Sure, they make CE products, too, but that&#8217;s absolutely nothing to do with this technology. We have a social conscience, buy our CE gear?
