If anyone has a spare grand sitting around they feel like spending this lovely evening, there&#8217;s a just-serviced [LSC Axiom 36/72 lighting console][1] going on eBay in a bit over 3 Â½ hours. In Melbourne, but with roadcase included. I&#8217;d buy it, but I&#8217;m broke&#8230; something to do with not being able to do any real work on account of trying to get \*nix setup forever. Ubuntu is perfect, but for the fact that it wouldn&#8217;t consider booting for me for some reason. Blame VIA/EPIA for their clone low-power hardware, methinks.
