Dropping out connections, etc., and general pain was the normal state of PC-syncing for this particular phone (probably exacerbated by my history with Windows Mobile perfection!) &#8212; so today I snapped and went looking for a software update.

If you&#8217;ve been let down by older versions of SE&#8217;s PC Suite software, give this version (<a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/downloads/PC%20Suite_2.10.38.exe">2.10.38</a> at time of writing, I was upgrading from I think 1.17.x?) a try. <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/downloads/PC%20Suite_2.10.38.exe">44MB download</a>, but well worth it.
