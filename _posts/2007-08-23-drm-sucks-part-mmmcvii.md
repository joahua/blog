Not like this hasn&#8217;t been said before, but I recently discovered a particularly retarded instance wherein DRM broke (and not for good). In this case it was a &#8220;bonus track&#8221; on a CD that had to be downloaded separately (problem number 1) and I&#8217;d let the CD disappear (I own the bloody thing somewhere, so sue me) but still had a 320kbps VBR-encoded MP3 copy sitting on the fileserver here. In the same folder as the MP3s was a WMA file laced with that certain poison &#8212; and here&#8217;s what it did when Windows Media Player went to acquire rights automagically:

And people wonder why I refuse to buy music online.
