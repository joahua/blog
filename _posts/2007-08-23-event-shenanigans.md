Lots of particleIllusion emitters aided by use of a Wacom A5 (6&#215;8) tablet that Tim brought to the party, a bit of Gephex processing, manual video loops, and hopefully the last MX-50 I will ever use (I love them to bits, but they&#8217;re very nearly redundant if these Gephex plans come to fruition).

In at 1630, out by 2245&#8230; if only all gigs were so expedient! We were just doing video, though, so it was fairly small. I managed to spend literally $100 on transport and parkingÂ ($50Â parkingÂ andÂ anotherÂ $50Â forÂ aÂ cabÂ toÂ returnÂ aÂ hire) which is nothing short of obscene&#8230; one day there&#8217;ll be an event where I can actually make money (yeah, right :P)

Pretty excellent evening, congrats to Felix & the SACS guys for running it&#8230; even if you were using a horrible hire company with cheap and nasty Chinese lighting!
