<p>This is a pretty awesome CAPTCHA project. It&#8217;s moderately accessible <em>and</em> useful for the CAPTCHA provider. It uses a confirmed keyword in conjunction with an unknown one in order to discover more about the second keyword and provide better humanness verification. That&#8217;s as non-technical an explanation as I think I can wrangle! If you&#8217;re worried about spam/need human authentication, check this service out.</p>
