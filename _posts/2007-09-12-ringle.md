Oh, someone please stop <a HREF="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/ringle-to-the-rescue/2007/09/11/1189276697318.html">these people</a>. Even my Sony Ericsson (yes, half owned by a notoriously evil record label) ships with software to rip CDs into non-DRM&#8217;d MP3s that function just fine as ringtones. What startling level of idiocy causes someone to think that <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Sony_BMG_CD_copy_protection_scandal">bundling more software</a> on <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Book_(audio_CD_standard)">CDs</a> is a remotely good idea I cannot fathom, but clearly one of the brains in a record company came up with this gem. It doesn&#8217;t really affect me on account of pretty much never buying CD singles, but even so&#8230; yuck.

If this ever finds its way onto real CDs (i.e. albums), I may just cry. I probably spend inÂ theÂ vicinityÂ of AU$60-75 a month on new albums, which is likely more revenue than you&#8217;d get if I bought things online&#8230; and I reckon a good half the reason I do that (aside from knowing what <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a> is and why I don&#8217;t want it on my music)Â is for the packaging and associated retailÂ experience.Â MostÂ recentÂ purchasesÂ includeÂ Gotye&#8217;sÂ <a HREF="http://gotye.com/?p=102">MixedÂ Blood</a>, MoS Australia&#8217;s <a HREF="http://www.ministryofsound.com.au/music_single_coloumn.cfm?page_id=22170681114311003&amp;se_id=116">Electro House Sessions</a> (it&#8217;s completely different from the global MoS release of the same name), Bob Sinclar&#8217;s <a HREF="http://www.ministryofsound.com.au/music_single_coloumn.cfm?page_id=46690802114311003&amp;se_id=115">Soundz of Freedom</a>, andÂ theÂ super duper excellent soundtrackÂ toÂ <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_Dead_Man's_Chest_(soundtrack)">Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#8217;s Chest</a>.

IÂ haveÂ rippedÂ eachÂ andÂ everyÂ trackÂ fromÂ themÂ allÂ asÂ WMAÂ Lossless. I wouldn&#8217;t have bought&#8230; about three of the four&#8230; if it wasn&#8217;t for retail CD stores.
