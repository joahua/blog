Apparently I&#8217;m [not the only one][1] [thinking this way][2] about Vista. Though it looks awful pretty, and if I bought a PC with it installed I&#8217;d probably have a hard time convincing myself to buy another XP license just so I didn&#8217;t have to use Vista for a few months! On the flip side, I would definitely consider holding off a hardware purchase that included a Vista license for a few more months, knowing a Service Pack is imminent.

Of course, if they&#8217;d got it right from the start, I&#8217;d be running Vista already&#8230; as it stands, I&#8217;m not too likely to drop $200 on something that runs slower than XP, supports less hardware, has arguably-worse power management, and makes the occasionally excruciating UI mistake (most notable is the automatic replacement of the &#8220;sleep&#8221; button with &#8220;install updates and shutdown&#8221; where updates are available). Really, the main reason I&#8217;d switch is to have consistent UI between Office 2007 and the rest of the system (instead of the presently absurd Vista-ish (but not *actually* Vista) UI available on XP), newer hardware (insofar as XP isn&#8217;t available), and a paid-for upgrade path&#8230; I&#8217;d rather fork out my money now and trust that another 3 service packs are coming, rather than pay full price for an OS and then pay full price [again][3], and [again][4]. I acknowledge this is partially a psychological thing stemming from my opposition for paying for point-releases, but even so&#8230; many of the alleged &#8216;upgrades&#8217; in OS X are thoroughly trivial.
