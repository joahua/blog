Nero is a fantastic piece of software. It is sorely missed. RIP, bundled CD burner. (Ironically, the only burner I have that was ever &#8216;new&#8217; in my possession was also the first to give up the ghost on CD burning). Bizarrely, it still works for DVDs just fine. Not a driver/OS-level thing. It&#8217;ll boot off a DVD, but not a CD. I think it&#8217;s a Sony, but that surely doesn&#8217;t mean much in this twisted world of re-/OEM-branded hardware. The thing that killed it was probably another Sony product that didn&#8217;t follow the real CD spec :P
