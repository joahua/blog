Irony is winding up with the same brand you were whinging about. But it was the only one in stock and I wanted on that day, and it had Nero bundled. So there we go. $55 for a DVD burner isn&#8217;t all bad, especially when it&#8217;s relatively quiet (compared to my Pioneer 108, anyway), and crazily speedy (I confess I&#8217;ve only tested burning on CDs yet, no DVDs). It&#8217;s black andÂ remarkablyÂ unshiny,Â butÂ SATAÂ andÂ inÂ needÂ ofÂ smallerÂ cables,Â whichÂ canÂ onlyÂ beÂ aÂ goodÂ thing!
