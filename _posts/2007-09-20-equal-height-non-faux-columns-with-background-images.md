I&#8217;ve had a fairly painful day experimenting with the [One True Layout Equal Height Column][1] technique in conjunction with a design that requires lots of rounded corners in all the wrong places (no, design will not yield to CSS!) and put out a call for help on the WSG mailing list for the first time in a while.

That place is magic. Gunlaug SÃ¸rtun came back in under six hours with another technique I hadn&#8217;t even heard of that looks pretty good, the [companion columns][2] method. He also has a page dedicated to [CSS table- styled columns][3], but it looks like it could involve a bit too much browser hacking (yes, IE) in order to be worthwhile.

More experimentation doubtless to come.
