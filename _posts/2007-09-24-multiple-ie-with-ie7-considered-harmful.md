Please do not [do this][1].

Especially do not do this and say that &#8216;it works fine for us&#8217; to visiting developers!

I&#8217;m currently installing a wonderful [free XPSP2 image with IE6][2] from the lovely folks at Microsoft&#8217;s IEBlog that actually *works* when testing webpages for legacy browsers. Please do this instead!
