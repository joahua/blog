I haven&#8217;t been this confused over <a HREF="http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/25/amazon-launches-drm-free-amazon-mp3-music-downloads/">a cool Internet service</a>&#8230; probably ever. <a HREF="http://www.amazonmp3.com/">AmazonMP3</a> is simultaneously one of the most exciting things to happen in online music ever, and a source of great personal confusion.

IÂ wantÂ toÂ useÂ itÂ (andÂ will)Â becauseÂ it&#8217;sÂ freakingÂ awesome.Â TheÂ bitrateÂ thingÂ doesn&#8217;tÂ massivelyÂ concernÂ me&#8230; generally speaking, I can&#8217;t tell the difference (though I will continue to rip my CDs as lossless, mostly in case I lose them). What concerns me is the potential undermining of my CD-store perusing ways as a result! I haven&#8217;t had to consider this until now because mainstream music simply hasn&#8217;t been available in a relatively open (don&#8217;t give me crap about MP3 patents, anyone can read them), DRM-free format.

It ships with artwork but that so doesn&#8217;t count.

**Oh, so apparently this post was a waste of time. Of course, it&#8217;s only licensed for US sales. I don&#8217;t know why that didn&#8217;t occur to me, but it didn&#8217;t. Now I&#8217;m grumpy. And irrationally craving popcorn.**

Well, if you&#8217;re in the US and using iTunes&#8230; stop. This is pretty cool for you guys, meanwhile I&#8217;ll keep buying my grey-market imported CDs (which is completely legal in Australia and morally fine). All that&#8217;s standing between me and Amazon&#8217;s MP3 music is a US shipping address for invoices, presumably, so I totally could just make one up. Not breaking any law that I&#8217;m under there. But whatever, it&#8217;s all too messy.

Yeah, that&#8217;s right, record companies screwed it up again.

We&#8217;ll get there, one day&#8230;
