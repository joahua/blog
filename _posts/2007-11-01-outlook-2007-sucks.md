Boring post subject, I know. But check this out:

![Outlook is preparing the requested view][1]

Took around a full minute for the folder to load, on an Athlon 64 3200+ clocked at 2.4GHz with 2GB of fairly quick memory.

Since when do apps alert in the tray about loading a view? If Outlook didn&#8217;t expend resources on a generally-useless tray icon (really, it doesn&#8217;t even change when you have new mail waiting), maybe it wouldn&#8217;t take so bloody long to do anything.

I&#8217;ve got a dual core 4200+ on the way, but really doubt it&#8217;ll make any difference when the fault is largely software that sucks. Not saying that it&#8217;s just Outlook at fault&#8230; I&#8217;m inclined to place a fair degree of blame on the well-known-to-be-sucky Windows Desktop Search. But it just integrates best&#8230; why does Microsoft have to produce products that suck?!

Speaking of which, my iPaq is working again with a brand new extended battery. Apart from the slow processor, it&#8217;s doing great&#8230; but I&#8217;m going to test-drive a Palm Z72 for a few days and see if it does any better. Basically, I don&#8217;t really need the GSM/GPRS functionality on the iPaq because it&#8217;s *faster* for me to connect via my Sony Ericsson via Bluetooth (as there&#8217;s no HSDPA on the iPaq). I&#8217;ll immediately miss the wireless, but have survived several months without it, and SDiO wifi cards are a possibility for the palm&#8230; I doubt they&#8217;re particularly common, though. Have been considering a Blackberry, but they&#8217;re pretty restricted in a whole heap of ways that PDAs aren&#8217;t. For example, ever tried getting an SSH client on a Blackberry? I haven&#8217;t. But have my doubts it could be done!

Anyway. Don&#8217;t use Outlook 2007 unless you have to.Â  It has nice multi-calendar/iCal support, but that&#8217;s about all it has going for it. *Still* no inbuilt SMS/MMS support, the renderer is a regression in the truest sense of the term (doesn&#8217;t even support background images &#8212; IE7 comes out, which is an awesome browser, and they decide it would be a good idea to force Word 2007 to be the renderer. Brilliant.), thoroughly *mediocre* RSS/feed-reading capabilities, and, to top it all off, it&#8217;s crap-slow (compared to earlier versions).

If it offers groupware advantages I don&#8217;t know of them (but doubt it could, it&#8217;s always been fairly comprehensive on that front), and chances are they won&#8217;t be particularly enabled until Server 2008 is released. Am guessing here, but not without some reasoning.

Avoid.

p.s. Yes, I&#8217;m probably overdue for a Windows reinstall.Â  Unfortunately a fairly major project cropped up just as I&#8217;d scheduled one, and I still haven&#8217;t got around to it. Will probably hunt down the right product key when the new CPU gets here early next week: that&#8217;s a large part of the problem, Microsoft apparently *expect* that home users either buy prebuilt systems with stupid crapware-filled restore disks, or are hardcore tech using pirates/MSDN users (same thing&#8230; the users rarely paid for the MSDN subs, mostly its their workplace). I have 5 XP Pro licenses of different varieties (not to mention previous versions of Windows), and of those a bunch are the same product type (upgrade)&#8230; which makes license management and compliance a bit of a challenge!

What I&#8217;d love MS to do is create a site-licensing product for SOHO users with flexible and transferable licensing at retail OEM pricing (that sounds dumb, but I mean still charging what us mortals pay for OEM licenses, not the volume prices that Dell, Lenovo, et al. get) &#8212; it&#8217;d be simple, web administered (not requiring a local server), and *increasingly relevant* in homes which are featuring more and more computers.
