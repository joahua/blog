A [list of International TLDs][1] is available on the IANA website. This includes the 11 IDNA i18n &#8216;test&#8217; domain names as of today, and excludes .root. Useful for knowing what your regex needs to match for email validation! Shortest 2, Longest 6, Longest inc. IDNA 18. There are no email users in the IDNA space at time of writing (and, at any rate, if they are they probably wouldn&#8217;t be particularly well supported by legacy email and DNS systems just yet!).
