My old OCZ 520 died a few months back, sadly, and I&#8217;d been running on a cheap and nasty power supply ever since (mostly on account of it being all I could afford at the time, and that the power supply conked out just when setting up for something!)

It was super nice and super shiny and under a super 5 year warranty, but only if I shipped it back to the US, at a cost of around $150. Crazy, huh? I&#8217;m sure there were cheaper options, but I couldn&#8217;t find them. And they probably involved boats, which just take too long :P

Anyway, I went to buy a video camera yesterday and sort-of-impulse-bought (coz I was at the store and had been thinking I really should get a decent PSU before something bad happens for a few months) a Corsair HX-620W. It had great reviews and was meant to be super quiet which is mostly what attracted me to it &#8212; I mean, sure, reliable power is great&#8230; but quiet PCs are better! I could&#8217;ve gone the Seasonic S12 but it&#8217;s not modular, or the M12, but it&#8217;s louder (extra 6cm fan)&#8230; so the Corsair, despite probably being manufactured by the same company and sharing a lot of identical design features, won.

It&#8217;s modular, which the OCZ wasn&#8217;t. Not a massive deal, but nice nonetheless. Makes for a tidier case:

You can see the modular connectors here:

I&#8217;m not using any of the SLI power at the minute (probably ever) but, again, nice to have in a future-proofing kind of way.

It&#8217;s also got one particularly massive fan. The OCZ had two 80mm fans that were super efficient and barely ever made any noise at all, but bigger typically means slower rotation & less whining noises, so it has to be a good thing. My HSF is massive enough and you can see even it&#8217;s small in comparison.

I also took advantage of the cleaning-up-the-insides to properly attach a few CCFLs that&#8217;d been lying around. Finally, the UV-responsive motherboard can glow properly!

I know, IDE cables suck&#8230; I&#8217;ve only got one IDE drive left, and it&#8217;s actually just there as a spare. Should take it out but haven&#8217;t had a chance just yet.

Anyway, whilst I was doing all this I realised my graphics card fan wasn&#8217;t spinning at all. It&#8217;d been making some funny noises when I&#8217;d done some stuff inside the case in the past, but I&#8217;d always dismissed it because nothing was crashing and I hadn&#8217;t changed anything to do with the graphics card. Turns out it hadn&#8217;t actually been spinning for ages and the fan had the driest bearings I&#8217;ve ever seen. The heatsink was plenty hot, but nothing was crashing. My system (CPU + memory) runs about 15% above clock but I&#8217;ve had no real cause to overclock the graphics card ([Fury][6] aside, but it needs more than just a faster clock!). So, consider this research that a cheap and nasty Palit GeForce 7600 GS *can* run with only passive cooling!

Ironically, that fan has the newest bearing in the system.

After I&#8217;d put everything back together I realised the chipset fan could probably do at the very least with a clean, but had rebooted by then and left it well enough alone.

Singer Oil is great, but I tried some spray Aquatec lubricant also which seems to be a little finer and would probably work quite well. The graphics fan squeaked a little when it started up&#8230; not quite sure why! It was pretty well oiled, but maybe it was still just working through the bearings completely.

Anyway&#8230; I think this computer&#8217;s nearly ready for summer&#8217;s soaring temperatures and increased power instability.
