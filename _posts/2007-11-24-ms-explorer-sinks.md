[This story][1] appeared in today&#8217;s SMH &#8212; note the erroneous (yet highly amusing) caption on the lead photo:

(screenshotted for posterity if they go editing)

They say they don&#8217;t know why it sunk. I blame Vista ;-)

**Update:**

So perhaps SMH&#8217;s typo was mixed up. ABC (Australia) are running a story on *their* website wherein it&#8217;s universally called the MS Explorer. An ill-fated name for a ship, no doubt!

Perhaps Midnight Commander or Finder would be a more successful name? ;-)
