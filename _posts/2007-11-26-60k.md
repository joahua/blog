This image makes 60,000 indexed items. A fair whack of that would be email, but far out that&#8217;s a lot of information. (It&#8217;s not just a count of files on a system, that&#8217;s just indexed documents in my home dir, projects workspace, and email accounts)

New laptop arrives Monday morning, and I&#8217;m trying to decide if I even want to move everything off this desktop or not! The laptop has half a TB of disc space across 2 drives (17&#8243; monster), so I&#8217;m considering it. I purchased it as a desktop replacement system and it is quite capable of that (specs at end of post)! The desktop provides a good backup should the laptop die/get stolen/run over by a bus, but at present the data is organised to be *used*, not archived.

By &#8220;used&#8221;, of course, I mean that liberally disorganised but most-recently-used-on-top sort of structure we fall into so easily. So I have a spot of sorting to do to get everything onto the laptop.

My last computer still has some stuff I&#8217;d like to get off it (particularly uni work&#8230; to the critics, yes, I do still go to uni!) but it&#8217;s been in at Youthworks not doing much since we moved offices, but heavy enough I haven&#8217;t bothered bringing it home again, since late last year.

The problem with desktops in particular is that they aren&#8217;t worth selling for their potential usefulness. My several-years-old computer (2.4GHz/768MB/somethingsomething&#8230; Ubuntu) in at Youthworks could maybe *just* sell for $350 given a clueless enough eBayer. My current desktop (no great slouch, AMD64 X2 4200+/2GB/7600GS) would be worth about the same to someone who knew what they were talking about&#8230; or perhaps $750 on eBay!

Even so &#8212; it&#8217;s useful to have spare machines &#8216;just in case&#8217; (for production stuff especially). I&#8217;d love to be able to swap those two desktops for laptops of similar vintage, but it&#8217;s just never going to be cost-effective. When people get rid of laptops, it&#8217;s because they suck (falling apart/general abuse, crap battery life, rubbish specs to start with, etc.). Not so with desktops, wherein most faults are redeemable at minimal cost. And even that minimal cost is often negated by the fact that there&#8217;s so much in the way of &#8216;spare&#8217; parts around the place!
