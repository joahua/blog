Functionality-crippling flickering post buttons that force me to disable JS, overly-adventurous self-updating plugins/upgrades that don&#8217;t work, and general slowness. File under &#8220;do-not-use&#8221; and &#8220;hazardous to blogging&#8221;.

Textpattern? Bluetrait? D-I-Y Django (with me and what time, exactly)?

I really *want* WordPress to work, if only because I know it can work so beautifully. Give me tagging and plugins and themes and flat pages and life is beautiful. Not that I&#8217;ve really had time to use any of those features in WP the last&#8230; ooh, I don&#8217;t even know&#8230; 18 months? But it&#8217;s important to know that they&#8217;re there.
