![Disk Management Windows Vista on my Dell laptop][1]

Can you ever have enough storage? I carry half a terabyte around with me on a daily basis, just in case, uh, I suddenly need to connect an HDV cam and record everything that happens for the rest of the day \*shifty eyes\* &#8230; yeah, it&#8217;s overkill. But overkill is the name of the production game. I&#8217;ve got two desktops that have been replaced by one desktop and this laptop &#8212; the laptop is a backup, primarily, and normally gets relegated to the oh-so-interesting task of PowerPointing (sometimes it gets to record audio, too&#8230; nice and spaciously even when it&#8217;s full of rips of video, just in case! The second hard drive normally houses any realtime data applications to make sure that normal response time isn&#8217;t impacted).

In case the main playout PC (has some fancy things that the laptop doesn&#8217;t, like RAID 0&#8242;d drives and better video processing hardware) decides to throw up, as it did late last year, the laptop serves as a ready-to-go alternative. I&#8217;m starting to carry a second, smaller laptop for slide playback &#8212; it&#8217;s a lot slower, but it also used to be the lightest laptop on the market (1.19KG) and I&#8217;m about to kit it out with solid state hard drive goodness. This makes it hopeless for recording/writing applications, but I&#8217;d never trust it with that, anyway. It does, however, ensure it&#8217;ll be lightning quick especially for applications like slide playback &#8212; ever had a hard drive spin down and pressed a key only to hear the computer laboriously whir back to life before changing slides? That&#8217;s one of the main attractions in retrofitting a relatively old laptop (it&#8217;s a Pentium III/256MB/touchscreen&#8230; the touchscreen is mostly what inspired the purchase when in China last time!) with a relatively new technology.

Of course, it&#8217;s quite possible none of this stuff will ever come in handy. But it might (and, surprisingly regularly, does). I just ordered about another 40 assorted connectors and cables that I&#8217;ve used, loaned, or lost over the course of the last year or so&#8230; not because they&#8217;re strictly necessary right now, but because they almost certainly WILL be (and, when you order them from cheap overseas suppliers, you can&#8217;t have stuff next-day when you need it!)

Anyway, I think it all ends up in the &#8220;better safe than sorry&#8221; basket. More important for some jobs than others, certainly.
