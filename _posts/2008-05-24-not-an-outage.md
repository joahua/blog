<p>Google.cn search queries for May 19th at 2:27pm took a bit of a hit, as follows:</p>

<p>Three minutes of national mourning for earthquake victims. Taken seriously and moving in a way that is a little difficult to imagine an analogue for in Australia &#8212; tongue-in-cheek about re:cessation of Google-ing&#8230; but intended as a broader comment on national displays of stuff in all seriousness. Perhaps unfair as Australia hasn&#8217;t really had any disaster of this magnitude in recent times, I know.</p>

<p>Everyone was outside as traffic stopped to remember and share in the grief of millions. Some things are more important than search.</p>
