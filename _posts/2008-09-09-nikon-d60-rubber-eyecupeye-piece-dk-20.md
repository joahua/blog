I should&#8217;ve known that some dude in a camera shop in Alice Springs wouldn&#8217;t know a whole lot about dSLRs. Stereotype fulfilled. By the time I got to Alice about a month ago, my D60&#8242;s eyecup was starting to fall apart and I wanted to get a replacement. The guy was unsure if such a thing existed and recommended a bit of superglue. I suddenly got very protective of the D60 body&#8230; no crazy outback solutions here, please!

Anyway. DK-20 is the eyecup part and it cost me all of $3.50 on eBay &#8212; it&#8217;s alarmingly genuine, too!

When I found it I was pretty thankful that the guy in Alice hadn&#8217;t had a clue&#8230; probably would&#8217;ve cost at least three times that!
