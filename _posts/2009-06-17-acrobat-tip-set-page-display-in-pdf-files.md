Have you ever wondered how to make your PDF files open in a particular page display layout? Sent a PDF of a booklet or magazine to someone and wondered how to make the title appear on its own page?

The &#8220;Initial View&#8221; setting in Adobe Acrobat is the answer. Simply open Document Properties (Ctrl+D on Windows, or âŒ˜+D in OS X) and click onto the &#8220;Initial View&#8221; tab. Here, you can set the initial page display format, opening page, zoom levels, and even what the title of the window is.

When you&#8217;re done, just close the Document Properties window and save your file. Easy!
