I just finished adding tags to each of the 1200+ posts on this blog. Needless to say, I enlisted help.

[Calais Archive Tagger][1], a free WordPress plugin, did most of the heavy lifting for me. It connects to a web service called [OpenCalais][2], run by ThomsonReuters (so nothing dodgy is going on with your data, they&#8217;re a pretty big publishing conglomerate!) The biggest problem with it is that, given the particular emphasis of OpenCalais towards establishing commonalities between different data sets, it paid a disproportionate amount of attention to proper nouns, and when product names were incomplete (for example, my old Pentax SP500 camera that I often just referred to as &#8220;SP500&#8243;) it would match tags to other products that had a more complete title. Which would be excellent if that were, in fact, what I was talking about.

I ended up sifting through the maybe 2500+ tags it created and deleting about 400 of those, and consolidating others.

I&#8217;m nowhere near HAPPY with the tags as representative of the content of each post, but, from the ones I&#8217;ve scanned, it&#8217;s most definitely better than nothing at all. Clearly categories are decreasingly relevant as stronger search capabilities have emerged over the past couple of years, so tags are a great way of enhancing searchable content &#8212; it&#8217;s not just about relating similar information, it&#8217;s about creating a mesh or network of content. This has SEO benefits, but can also function as a barometer of the type and nature of content being discussed. For the record, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a fantastic barometer for this blog just yet!

One other unexpected thing it did was expose some spam that had found its way into a handful of posts through old WordPress vulnerabilities (I presume pre-2.8 era)&#8230; there were only three, with probably negligible Page Rank effects for anyone.
