I stumbled across this document, [Two Old English Elegies from the Exeter Book: *The Wanderer* and *The Ruin* (PDF)][1] when hunting for a public-domain English translation of another Old English poem, *[Vainglory][2]*. The author of theÂ linkedÂ document has also translated this, but unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t look like it made the cut for any of his courses published online.

For reference, there is *a* translation of [the poem][3], it&#8217;s just not the one I was looking for. R.M.Liuzza&#8217;s *Beowulf: a new verse translation* (2000) has a pretty mammoth series of appendices including a translation of *Vainglory* on page 209-211.
