As per a posting I made to the [WSG][1] list earlier this afternoon:

> We have a problem! Outlook 2010, [according to Campaign Monitor][2], is going to continue to use the crippled MS Word layout engine. They adopted this as the status quo for Outlook 2007 and promptly set rich email with CSS, etc., back a number of years, and are showing no great sign of diverging from this path. However, there is hope! Campaign Monitor have started a [website][3] in conjunction with their &#8220;[Email Standards Project][4]&#8221; &#8212; essentially a standards advocacy website. They need your support now more than ever.
> 
> [FixOutlook.org][3] aims to collate the community&#8217;s discontent with this decision using Twitter to change Microsoft&#8217;s policy decision on this one before it&#8217;s too late and we&#8217;re stuck with yet another five-ten years of inferior email authoring!

This is a really important issue for anyone involved in email marketing, and well worth taking the effort to make some noise about. Essentially, if we don&#8217;t get off this track it&#8217;ll be years until it is possible to drop support for these inferior clients (as is the case with IE6, now) and we&#8217;ll all be dealing with sub-par mailing authoring, cross-compatibility, and display issues for a while to come.

Get tweeting! :)
