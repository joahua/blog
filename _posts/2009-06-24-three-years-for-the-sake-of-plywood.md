Traveled over to [Shanghai Scrap][1] today (h/t [Danwei][2]) to a post entitled &#8220;[Plywood Infernal][3]&#8220;, written following a visit to a large factory in a northern Chinese city. The author, Adam, writes: &#8220;I donâ€™t know much about the plywood industry, and not much more about what drives a young person from a village to a deadly factory in a town without a future.&#8221;

Essentially, the manufacturing processes continue to use [a carcinogenic chemical][4] in quantities and with exposure to workers such that, if what Adam was told by other residents in this village is true, employees in this factory can *expect* they have less than three years to live before contracting a terminal illness.

Ours is a messed up world.
