I enjoyed the latest Harry Potter film last night &#8212; and it is the first in the series I am genuinely able to say that about. The rest have been frustrating for a variety of reasons. Some are technically poor, others are merely victims of terrible direction and script work.

The latest, however, has been remarked upon by various reviewers as taking a significantly darker turn &#8212; reflected both in (generally) well-done digital colour grading as well as thematically. The idea of &#8220;darkness&#8221; in this film is intriguing, particularly in light of the acknowledgement of Dumbledore as one of the greatest wizards of all time and the continuing struggle and dichotomy between forces of good and evil in the film.

The demise of Dumbledore (oh, yeah, spoiler alert &#8212; but you&#8217;ve already read the books, right?), that great force for good, represents a notable setback for this cause. I mention him particularly because he is, until this moment in the saga, the character with the most complete view of the situation. He is wisest and most powerful. However, as he enters the cave containing a horcrux with Harry, I was frustrated with their collective inability to illuminate the room.

Cry *lumos* as loudly as they may, even Dumbledore&#8217;s casting of beacons of light across the cave fails to significantly brighten the environment. I was reminded of the triumph over darkness that God has given us in Jesus, so absolute that fiction does not even approach its conquest. The Bible speaks of a future, renewed creation where God&#8217;s holy city has no need of a moon, or a sun, for it is so illuminated by the glory of His presence. (Revelation 21:23-24)

This is not fiction, and there is no battle that has not already been won by Jesus Christ the living king of all.

> &#8230;that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.
