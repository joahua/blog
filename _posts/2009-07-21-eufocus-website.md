[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1584" title="eu focus website" src="http://josh.st/blog/wp-content/2009/07/eufocus.jpg" alt="eu focus website" width="384" height="402" />][1]Spent a little while this afternoon cooking up a small website for [SUEU][2]&#8216;s international student group, Focus. Born largely out of the realisation that http://www.sueu.org.au/activities/international_students/ is probably just a little too long to be catchy, it&#8217;s just a microsite designed to be relatively static (as the current page is) and redirect people to real-world activities.

Hopefully the new [euFocus web address][1] will serve well and be a tad more bite-sized/amenable to inclusion on posters, print media, etc. For usability, I&#8217;ve gone the non-geek route: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eufocus.org/">http://www.eufocus.org/</a> (nofollow&#8217;d here) can pick up anyone who needs a normal-looking web addres via 302 redirect. Lovely.

Future ambitions may include online event rego and internationalisation fun times, as about 90% of Focus-ers are from mainland China. This will ideally take the form of user agent locale identification &#8212; it&#8217;s not mission critical and geolocation stuff is largely irrelevant for what is a very geographically constrained activity.
