<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1594" title="Sunrise over Coogee @ TG HQ" src="http://josh.st/blog/wp-content//2009/08/tg-office-sunrise.jpg" alt="Sunrise over Coogee @ TG HQ" width="700" height="284" />

Friday was a pretty insane day, but I snapped this photo (cameraphone, dunno what happened top right!) arriving at [our][1] office in the morning before getting into it. We&#8217;ve got a pretty incredible view over Coogee, which is fantastic&#8230; except for when the sea and sky are such amazing colours and you know there&#8217;s not a chance of actually getting outside to it!

There were some sheets of light rain and these incredible clouds that cleared off to perfect skies and an ocean that even I, someone who doesn&#8217;t particularly rate swimming and has never learnt to surf despite living within 5km of the coast his whole life, wished I was free to head over to.

> It is good to give thanks to the Lord,  
> to sing praises to your name, O Most High;  
> to declare your steadfast love in the morning,  
> and your faithfulness by night,  
> to the music of the lute and the harp,  
> to the melody of the lyre.  
> For you, O Lord, have made me glad by your work;  
> at the works of your hands I sing for joy.
> 
> &#8211; Psalm 92

We were made to work even before sin entered the world, but I reckon work/time-outside-on-a-beautiful-day balance would&#8217;ve been better then! For those trust Jesus, a future is coming where every day all are freed to give thanks to Him forever&#8230; Â even those stuck in beige office towers!
