I&#8217;m heading up to Darwin next month to an [education conference][1] we&#8217;re sponsoring and I stumbled across something vastly amusing when researching the event.

Here&#8217;s something that probably falls outside the bounds of what you&#8217;d think to run due diligence on: checking the venue an event is being hosted in has completed construction and is actually operational! Thankfully, the [Darwin Convention Centre][2] does, and Google is just a few months behind on the imaging.

It opened on July 1st and is part of a broader reinvigoration master plan for Darwin&#8217;s waterfront precinct. If you&#8217;ll be in Darwin between September 26-28 this year, check out the [ACEL conference &#8220;Tipping Points&#8221;][1] or get in touch.
