Sydney&#8217;s covered in a dust storm this morning and everyone&#8217;s talking about it. It&#8217;s pretty funky coloured and unprecedented in recorded history. Tori says [Thank God][1] in her new blog (at least, that&#8217;s the blog&#8217;s focus :)) &#8211; others say more amusing things. Here&#8217;s a sample.
