*From Tori*

Tonight while driving me home, Josh and I stopped at Maccas and bought a chocolate sundae. He asked me whether there are McFlurries in China and I said yes. He was glad, and joked that this isn&#8217;t something he&#8217;d be willing to give up for Jesus. We laughed, because this isn&#8217;t true. We both would give up much more than McDonald&#8217;s icecreams for Jesus. I love this boy.
