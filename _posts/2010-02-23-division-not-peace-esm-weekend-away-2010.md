This weekend Evening Church from St Matthias went away to the Northern Beaches together on a weekend entitled &#8220;Division Not Peace&#8221;, examining Jesus&#8217; teachings from Luke&#8217;s account of his life.

The teachings of Jesus were clearly divisive in the Gospels and continue to be so today. Light illuminates darkness. Christ reveals sin.

He also pays for it. And is worth following. The unsweetened reality of the end of Luke 9 is at once immensely painful and wholly true.

Our speaker, David Ould, faithfully preached Jesus&#8217; words without coating them in false comfort or apologising for their truth and goodness. The hard truth of the gospel is such that, though we find great joy in the King who pays sin&#8217;s great price, we wept and prayed for those who do not yet acknowledge Him.

We fail as much as any fallen, sinful people do. Pray for us that we would love like Jesus, which rightly includes declaring the reality of division as sin is exposed by the gospel.
