We recently refreshed one of [our][2] core product websites, [Equip Schools][1]. It hits a fairly complex mix of schools, parents/carers and individual students and we spent a lot of time trying to best articulate how the programme speaks to the varied concerns of each of these groups.

The product has three curriculum-driven strands in the form of workshops, publications and software.

The software strand is certainly the most distinct of the three in terms of conventional expectations of life-skills / personal management programmes that schools already run &#8211; and we&#8217;re still coming to terms with the best way to articulate that within the website. We&#8217;ve developed a brief (16 minute) training DVD that accompanies the product &#8211; however, this is obviously too long for initial contact and, while being highly explanatory, doesn&#8217;t really articulate the thousands of hours of educational psychology research and student mentoring that inform the product as it stands today.

Distilling that down to a 10 minute package is a tall ask, but it&#8217;s also something near on the horizon as we seek to make this available to individuals beyond the school context.
