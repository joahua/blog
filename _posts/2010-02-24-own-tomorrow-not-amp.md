I stumbled across quite a visually beautiful [commercial][1] today. Its script follows:

> In the future, one thing is certain.
> 
> Someone&#8217;s going to drive it.
> 
> Someone&#8217;s going to collect it.
> 
> Someone&#8217;s going to lie on it. Sit on it. Sleep on it.
> 
> Drink too much German beer on it.
> 
> Someone will sit in front row seats, here, here and here.
> 
> Someone will land it. Someone will save it. Someone will find it. Then get happily lost in it.
> 
> Someone will sleep five stars, someone will sleep under the stars.
> 
> Someone will ski down it, fly over it, and scream across it.
> 
> Beautiful things will still be made in the future. Someone is going to buy them.
> 
> Someone&#8217;s going to walk it. Someone is going to ride it.
> 
> And at the end of the day, someone&#8217;s going to watch it.
> 
> And there&#8217;s no reason why that someone can&#8217;t be you.
> 
> Since 1849, AMP has helped more Australians own their tomorrows.
> 
> Own tomorrow. AMP.

Emotive as it was, it is also, of course, absolute hogwash &#8212; GFC or no!

Someone once told this story:

> A rich man once thought to himself, â€˜What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?â€™
> 
> He decided, â€˜I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.â€™
> 
> But God said to the man, â€˜Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?â€™

You don&#8217;t own your tomorrow. It&#8217;s not even yours today. The Bible says there is one good kind of storing up to be done &#8211; I can &#8220;store up God&#8217;s word in my heart,Â that I might not sin against Him.&#8221; (Ps 119:11) &#8211; yet I still fail and need to fall upon His mercy.

The man who told that story was Jesus. (Luke 12:16-20) He promises peace and a greater security than all the riches of the world.

Own eternal life. Jesus.
