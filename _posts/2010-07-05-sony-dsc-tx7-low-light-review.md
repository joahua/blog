Just bought a cheapie compact digital (well, next to the Nikons I usually chuck around) to do some low effort filming with and decided to (literally) take it for a drive. Titles and speed are the only changes I&#8217;ve made to the footage apart from the fact it&#8217;s only PAL widescreen.

The camera did okay, but for the slight inability to focus a lot of the time (and forget manual focus, this is a strictly for-dummies camera) &#8211; no vertical flaring or other weirdness that has plagued many a digital still camera in the past.

For me, it was a toss up between jello-vision D90 land and getting a compact digital that would do HD (1080/50i) well enough to last in situations where hiring a real camera is total overkill. Biggest downside so far seems to be battery life. The internal mic is decent enough for a lot of uses because, beautifully, the whole thing is pretty much solid state and the zoom is internal/not-that-noisy. The few unfavorable (audio) reviews out there seem to come from the party video crowd &#8211; and they&#8217;re right, no, it will not deal well with TiÃ«sto&#8217;s basslines.

Crap battery life aside, seems like a decent camera so far.
