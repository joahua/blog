I heard precisely one person complaining loudly when [WordPress 3.0][1] first released but I&#8217;ve hit no snags so far &#8211; elegant, painless upgrade on [WebFaction][2] (Disclosure: I&#8217;ve got an affiliate link in there, 10% of your spend &#8211; but I&#8217;d recommend them even if you want to strip the link out) which is more than can be said for most web hosts I&#8217;ve used over the years.

Admittedly I&#8217;m not using the most zany set of plugins in the world, but it&#8217;s nice to know that an open source project can be so darn painless. Upgrade, the water&#8217;s fine.
