This was the first time I ever encountered this face-detection feature, and it just so happened Facebook picked a particularly poor photo to introduce it with!

Clearly they&#8217;ve started using a face-detection algorithm to pinpoint probable candidates for tagging &#8211; unfortunately, the algorithm is easily fooled by *V for Vendetta* masks. The photo in question features four friends and we have no idea who is whom &#8211; it was a few years ago and we&#8217;re all identically clothed!

Nice one, [Facebook][2]!
