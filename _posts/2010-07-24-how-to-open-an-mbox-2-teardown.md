Here are some teardown instructions/destructions for opening up Digidesign&#8217;s Mbox 2. This little journey took place after the USB port decided it would be a great time to fail, thus rendering the entire device useless. Got to love it when a $2 part breaks a $500 device, huh?

Presented with a choice of shipping it off for at least 2 weeks and some probably-not-insignificant freight costs (the device in question was under warranty but a parallel import from the US), the best option was, of course, to crack the thing open.

YouTube evidence of the (highly successful) insanity follows:



I&#8217;ve been using it reliably for about a week now and can say confidently that no damage was done! In fact, it&#8217;s actually sounding better, too.

Not only did the USB port coming loose stop data from flowing, it also caused grounding issues and introduced some hum/other noise when it was incorrectly positioned. The new USB port has not only stopped the device from spontaneously disconnecting, it&#8217;s also improved the quality of the audio recorded. Brilliant.
