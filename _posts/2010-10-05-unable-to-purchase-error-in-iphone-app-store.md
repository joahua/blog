Just got an &#8220;Unable to Purchase&#8221; error while updating a bunch of different apps on my iPhone using the App Store.

It didn&#8217;t affect the actual upgrade, but the error appeared twice before I entered my iTunes password &#8211; after a quick search it seems the problem is related to changed system times. I hadn&#8217;t attempted an update since before daylight savings started here three days ago, so I&#8217;m assuming that is the reason.

For me, this didn&#8217;t actually prevent anything from working &#8211; but leave a comment if you&#8217;ve had more specific problems. If time related, it&#8217;s a curious limitation on the app store indeed (app rental?). More likely it&#8217;s just some boring transactional code playing up, but who knowsâ€¦
