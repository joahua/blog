There&#8217;s no native way to do this &#8211; and I&#8217;ll spare you the lecture about [editing delivery formats][1], because, let&#8217;s face it, you&#8217;re reading this because you&#8217;re probably stuck with one.

You can stuff around with AviSynth scripts, or you can give up and transcode using Handbrake or another 3rd party tool &#8211; or you can be clever about it and use a remuxing tool that&#8217;s much faster and better quality. [SmartLabs][2] have a freeware (not open source) product called [tsMuxeR][3] (edit: link reported broken in comments &#8211; [mirror][4])that will do exactly this that worked like a charm on Windows 7, but there are also versions for Linux and OS X available.

Worth a shot if you&#8217;re stuck with a video file Premiere doesn&#8217;t want to know about.
