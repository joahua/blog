Or will it?

If you&#8217;re setting up a new computer and have Authorized This Computer (Store -&gt; Authorize This Computer) already, it seems weird that iTunes won&#8217;t let you just sync your apps from the device.

For whatever reason, you ALSO need to &#8220;Transfer Purchases from&#8221; the iPhone or iPod in question. Crazy huh? Nevertheless, it&#8217;s actually pretty straightforward.
