OS X is a bit retarded, but what the [rest of the world][1] thinks Home / End should do, Mac users can achieve by pressing Shift + Home / Shift + End or Control + A / Control + E respectively. I&#8217;m talking about how to move your cursor to the beginning or end of a line, of course!

If you&#8217;re on one of those special midget keyboards (a laptop?) that lacks useful buttons like Home and End, you&#8217;re probably looking for Shift + Fn + Left / Shift + Fn + Right.

There are a bunch of ways you can remap the key bindings, but in the interests of staying sane when working on others&#8217; machines, it&#8217;s probably worth changing your muscle memory instead of your bindings here. It&#8217;s also worth noting that Vim users can use ^ / $ for beginning / end of line respectively.
