DUNS numbers (Duns and Bradstreet) are needed for a few things business-related but you run your own business you&#8217;ve probably never got around to applying for one.

If you&#8217;ve registered a company in Australia, chances are you&#8217;ve already got a DUNS number. Surprising, huh?

[Search for your business][1] and a DUNS number will be available top left, just above the company name or ABN.

I discovered this while trying to register for [Apple&#8217;s iOS Enterprise program][2], which requires a DUNS number as part of the application process. You can sign up for the developer program without one (and it&#8217;s cheaper), but to privately manage and distribute apps you need enterprise access.

As we prepare to launch our [Equip Mobile program into schools][3], the ability to roll out software to all users in an organisation is something we need to be across!
