Dear RTA, I know you justÂ [spent a lot of money][1] finding out exactlyÂ *how* unpopular you are &#8211; now I&#8217;m telling you why. This one&#8217;s on the house.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1699" title="RTA renewal/Greenslip/Safety check" src="http://josh.st/blog/wp-content//2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-31-at-2.09.43-PM.png" alt="" width="348" height="214" />

Think of this as an (il)logic puzzle. Want to renew? Go get a green slip. Got a greenslip? Go get another safety check. Want to just give us money and do the others out of order? Nope, sorry, you can&#8217;t do that.

N/A in the Safety Check column actually means &#8220;you&#8217;re covered for now, don&#8217;t sweat it&#8221; &#8211; but you wouldn&#8217;t know it from the form. There&#8217;s a vicious red X if you&#8217;re not covered, but nary a tick if you are.Â Also, what&#8217;s with the grotesquely antialiased &#8220;i&#8221; rollovers?
