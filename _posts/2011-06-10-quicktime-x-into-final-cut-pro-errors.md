If you&#8217;ve made a screen recording using Quicktime X, you&#8217;ll likely have difficulty importing it into Final Cut Pro 7 because of its variable framerate.

The easiest way to resolve this is to take the file through Compressor first &#8211; ProRes 422 Progressive will be great. Frustrating, but whatever.
