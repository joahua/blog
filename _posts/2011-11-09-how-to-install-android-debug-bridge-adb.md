The latest Android SDK doesn&#8217;t ship with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) included.

Instead, you need to add it by installing the &#8220;Android SDK Platform-tools&#8221; package via the Android SDK Manager.

Once you&#8217;ve done this, it will be available under {path to Android}/android-sdk/platform-tools/ instead of its old location under android-sdk/tools/

Simple!
