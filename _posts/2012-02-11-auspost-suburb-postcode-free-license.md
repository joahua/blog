Australia Post provide a [nice convenient CSV][1] of all of their postcode data, and then proceed to make the license quite prohibitive.

Commercial use? No. Open source modification? No. Redistribution? Nope.

This is really annoying, but thankfully there&#8217;s another option. For your bookmarking pleasure, enter [https://github.com/joahua/AusPostcode][2]. It&#8217;s a CC-BY licensed version of suburb/postcode data in both CSV and JSON formats (feel free to fork and submit a pull request if you&#8217;ve got others) based on Australian census data that&#8217;s much more permissively licensed.

Happy free/open-source postcoding!
