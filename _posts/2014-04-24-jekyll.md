First update in quite a whileâ€¦ but worth noting this blog is now powered by Jekyll after a pretty bad run of security things with WordPress (my fault: not keeping it up to date, their fault: security holes every other day).

Good news is everything is static and Github Pages hosted now. Comments have gone to Disqus (for better or worse), and analytics stays on GA (I just upgraded their circa 2007 Urchin tracking JS). Love it when stuff starts to work.
