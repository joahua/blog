Hi there, thanks for stopping by!

<img class="alignright" title="Me, at some point." src="/blog/wp-content/static/hotgeek.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="168" />I&#8217;m a geek who loves Jesus and desires him to be first in all things, including About pages. He is the reason for being, the reason we continue to exist, and the only hope of salvation in a world ravaged by sin. Everything I owe to him: there&#8217;s nothing I can do alone, nor should there be any reason to without everything God accomplished through his life. If you&#8217;d like to know more about what it means to follow Jesus Christ, take a look at [this really short explanation][1], then [get in touch][1] if you&#8217;d like to learn more!

Long-time Sydney resident, I go to [church in Erskineville][2], studied at [uni in Darlington][3], and live in Dulwich Hill. I&#8217;m married to [Tori][4] &#8211; she&#8217;s pretty amazing. I&#8217;m also attempting to study Chinese with a medium-term goal of living in China, whilst keeping up all sorts of technology-related shenanigans.

### Professional bio follows:

For over 7 years, Josh Street has worked on a wide range of web and technology projects for clients big and small. Participation in a variety of technology communities such as the 4,000-strong [Web Standards Group][5] since 2003 has served to further expertise, particularly in **front-end web development** (XHTML/CSS/JavaScript) and **web standards/best practices** (accessibility, usable design, and SEO).Â 

Whether working to crush that last rendering bug in the latest web browser, to directing multiple cameras sitting behind a vision switcher, he relishes a challenge and opportunities to develop new skills and harness established and proven ones. With a background in front-end web development and accessibility best practices proven on some of Australia&#8217;s most demanding web projects for a diverse range of clients, Josh brings a wealth of experience in standards-based design practices. Specialising in the development of usable websites, he implements designs for universal access including mobile devices and search engines (SEO) to improve the reach and effectiveness of web properties.

Since mid-2008, I&#8217;ve been involved with [Equip Schools][6], where I head up the technology side of an education business that&#8217;s reached over 35,000 students across Australia.
