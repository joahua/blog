Copyright of this website, *including* user-submitted comments (see [Comment policy][1]), generally belongs to its purveyor, Joshua Street. Exceptions will be denoted where required, generally citing reproduction as &#8220;fair use&#8221;. Legally ambigubious here in Oz, but this is a personal site so I&#8217;m not that worried.

#### Disputes

If you think I&#8217;ve raped and pillaged your content and now you&#8217;re going to send an army of lawyers significant enough they&#8217;re going to need to rent an Olympic stadium to hold the trial, I have two things to say. One, calm down. I&#8217;m one individual, and any damages you might possibly get are going to be significantly less than the cost of your lawyers. (Or even their legal fees for sending intimidating emails. And I don&#8217;t generally respond kindly to those.) Two, more importantly, please [contact me][2]. If you think it&#8217;s urgent (or the contact form is broken), you can get me on my mobile: (+61) 0425 808 469.

#### Terms of use

On to more important things. Saying I have copyright over everything on this site is a sweeping assertion carrying baggage I *don&#8217;t* want: namely, exclusive use of my content.

You can have it. For free. Ish.

The way I used to do this was as follows:

> This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons License][3].

Which is perfectly okay, I guess. Morally, though, I feel it&#8217;s too restrictive. All I&#8217;m doing is pressing a bunch of keys here. That&#8217;s not *worth* anything. On this point I fear I&#8217;m [something of a Marxist][4] (I think. I never quite understood that whole thing, possibly because it branches and forks and contradicts all over the place.), but the point stands: at least to some extent, I think it&#8217;s wrong for me to claim ownership over a bunch of words.

So here&#8217;s how it goes. If it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve written/created and posted on this site, and it&#8217;s not otherwise marked, you can have it. Commercial use, non-commercial use, whatever. Attribution is emphatically *encouraged*, but not required. Similarly, notification you&#8217;ve *used* XYZ would be nice&#8230; and if it&#8217;s commercial, it&#8217;d be nice to have a copy of whatever you&#8217;ve done. But, again, it&#8217;s not required.

#### Comments {#commentpolicy}

Comments are a little more of a dubious beast. I&#8217;ve asserted ownership over them above, but it&#8217;s hard to apply that retro-actively. Having said that, it&#8217;s unlikely anyone will care too much. Still, if you want to be careful, consider comments made after November 4, 2005, as having that policy applied: not before. This means you can use it for whatever you want, as per above. Again, attribution (ideally to the comment author) is nice but not required.
